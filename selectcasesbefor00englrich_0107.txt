INTRonth'rION ciii

And then all the above-named lords gave assurances to the king in
the following manner. The three uncles of the king, the prelates, and
other lords promised in good saith and assured the king in his hand
that they would from this time forth be his loyal subjects and would
do nothing privily or openly, by themselves or through their followers,
against the king, nor would they (act) one lord against another, or
against the people oppressively, except by law. And if peradventure
any lord or other man of whatever estate should act to the contrary,
(they promised) that all the lords would stand by the king in compel-
ling the refractory one to obey the king and his laws. And in case
any lord feels himself aggrieved, he will not take redress by force
against the law, but will pursue by common law or complain to the
king in order to gain redress and remedy, so that the laws of the reahn
may be maintained between the king and his lieges of whatever estate.
And the king on his part for the complete comfort of his lords and
other lieges of his own will and good beart, to cultivate good and com-
plete devotion in his reahn, has promised on the word of a king to do
no wrong or damage to any lord or other of his lieges for anything
that has happened heretofore, for which he may have reason to be
moved against them or any one of them. And it is not his intention
to restore any of those who have been adjudged in full parliament in
his reahn or in any place belonging to the crown.⁹

but now in 1393 the peasants in the manors of Winkfield, Hurst, and
Whistley were combim'ng to resist the extortions, as they allege, of the
Abbot of Abingdon. F irst the abbot proceeded against the tenants, com-
plaim'ng that his bondmen were rebelliously withdrawing their services
and were confederating unlawfully² by oath in assemblies to resist him
and his ministers. On this information the king issued a commission of
oyer and terminer, dated 14 May, 1393, with power to judge and imprison
all who might be convicted.³

The tenants did not lack intelligent leaders who inquired into the title
of the abbey.⁴ In moving the present petition they followed the course that
other peasants had taken, attacking the claims of the abbey to be lord of the
