taken to the abbey of Abingdon under safeguard‚ and were there shut and
imprisoned in a house, and the said abbot and his counsel made certain
writings‚ of what matter the said prisoners know nothing, and these men
came to the said Stephen, Thomas, and John in prison, and would have
made them enseai the said writings, whereas they refused everything fur-
ther, and then certain (rnen) of their counsel of their own authority en-
sealed the said writings, and now they submit that· the tenants have en-
sealed the said writings‚¹⁵ whereas they have never done anything; and
then the said John Benefeld and William Staverton and one John Warfeld,
who is dead, entered all the lands and tenements of the said Stephen,
Thomas, and John Saman and still detain them together with all their
goods and chattels found there to their own use. And moreover, whereas
certain forfeitures and escheats have been given to our iord the king by
diverse inquests taken before the escheator there, the said John Benefeld
and william Staverton and others of their adherence lately anew caused
an inquest of their affinity, covin‚ and livery to be held against our lord
the king at Maidenhead concerning the same forfeitures and escheats
amounting to 40 marks and more, and so the tenants are ousted of all that
they had because they were unwilling to yield and consent to the said
abbot, John Benefeld and William Staverton and others of their covin in
order to disinherit our lord the king of part of his lordship there, wherefore
they pray for a commission directed to certain justices to inquire of all
the grievances, wrongs, and extortions thus done as well to the said tenants
as in prejudice and diminution of the lordship of our lord the king there, or
else that they be required to come before the council to answer for the
matter aforesaid and for other things that will be submitted to them for
the profit of our said lord the king.¹⁷

Humbly beseecheth his poor chaplain Nicholas Hogonona 2 of the land
of Ireland that whereas he lately proposed to go on a pilgrimage to the
court of Rome by reason of certain vows that he had made, and so came to
England, and when he had come to Oxford he associated with a friar Austin,
and gave him 40 d. and his costs to bring him to London, and also he de·
livered to the said friar 60 S. to keep; and when they had come to London
the said poor chaplain demanded the return of his said money and wished
to have suit for his writ of passage,³ and in the meantime the said friar
