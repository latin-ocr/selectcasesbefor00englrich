be men of substance in their respective counties.⁷ The out-cry against false
indictments, by which “ loyal folk were often grieved and evilly im-
prisoned,” rose again in 1327, when the king's justices were ordered to take
cognizance of such cases.⁸ The particular grievance in this instance was
that the sheriffs put compulsion upon persons to prefer indictments, and
this may be the secret of the numerous inquests to which the complainants,
Ughtred and the Hothams, allege that they were vexatiously subjected.
So persistent were the complaints that in 1330 the king and count-il took
the drastic measure of removing all the sheriffs and their subordinates
throughout England and putting them on their trial before a legal com-
mission.⁹ The enactment of 1327 that “in every county good men and
lawful which be no maintainers of evil or barretors in the county should
be assigned to keep the peace,’' ¹⁰ thereby bringing into existence the
county magistracy, further reduced the influence of the sheriffs; while in
1330, the Act ¹¹ which established “keepers of the peace '’ throughout
England forbade the sheriff to let to bail or mainprise those indicted before
them. Nevertheless, the sheriffs were still recognized as “ keepers of the
peace‚'' though second only to the new officials who presently attained the
style of “ justices of the peace.’' ¹2 It is to be noted in this connexion that
Musgrave in his defence is careful to mention that he was one of the
justices of the peace.¹³

Now the charges against Musgrave were the more credible, in that they
were not the first of the kind heard against the sheriff of York. Just a few
years before, in 1358, there is the following entry on the Close Roll: “ To
the sheriff of York (Peter de Nuttle). Order under pain of „4:100 to desist
from extortions, grievances, and injuries inflicted by him contrary to the
great charter and other statutes: as the said charter and statutes contain
that no sheriff or bailiff shall hold his tourn except twice a year and that in
due and customary place, to wit once within a month after Easter and once
within a month after Michaelmas, and if any sheriff do otherwise he should
lose his tourn for that time, that sheriffs should take indictments by in-
dented roll, one part to remain with indictors and the other with him who
would take the inquisition, so that indictments may not be concealed; and
now the king has learned from people of the county that the sheriff holds
his tourns as often as and whenever he pleases without the customary
places, takes indictments and inquisitione in private places without any
indenture, under colour of which indictments he causes many men of the
county to be taken and imprisoned at his pleasure until he has exacted
heavy fines and ransoms for their mainprise.'’ ¹⁴ Sheriff Nuttle was ordered
