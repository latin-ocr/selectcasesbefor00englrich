REX v. MIDDLETON

The special importance of this case is its bearing upon the whole history
of the office of escheator. It was perhaps inevitable that an officer, whose
function was the seizure of private estates into the king's hand, should be
unpopular, and that escheators ¹ should be habitually complained against,
along with sheriffs and purveyors, as the most corrupted ministers of the
crown. Usually it was the people who suffered from their extorffions, but some-
times the king himself was defrauded. It was therefore a problem of long
standing how the escheators should be appointed and controlled. Origi-
nally there appears to have been a single escheator for the entire kingdom?
Henry III began the system of two escheators, one for the lands north of
the Trent and the other for the lands south of the Trent. In 1346 he divided
the country further under four escheators, with subescheators for each
county.³ But the dual system returned. In response to local sentiment
Edward I ordained that sheriffs should be escheators in their respective
counties.⁴ Possibly they were intended to act as subeseheators, for the
two escheators‚ north and south of the Trent, were continued.⁵ As a check
upon the general escheators, they were not permitted to remain in office
long, and encouragement was given to all who wished to complain against
1116111.ὃ Still there was a feeling that over areas so large these officers were
too powerful and too little responsible to local interests. Without abolish-
ing the two general escheatorships, Edward III added several regional
escheators, one for Somerset, Dorset, Devon, and Cornwa113 another for
Surrey, Sussex, Kent, and Middlesex; another for York, Northumberland,
Curnberland, and Westmoreland.⁷ In 1340 he consented to a statute,
superseding the system of two escheators and establishing “diverse
escheators of less estate,” who should be chosen every year in the
exchequer just like the sheriffs.⁸ Under this system there was a ready
inclination, as Edward Ι had proposed, to let the sheriffs be escheators
in their respective counties. Just as William Middleton was sheriff and
escheator in Norfolk and Suffolk, so it was in most of the counties
of England. In the year 1350, for example, out of the twenty-nine
counties that are available for comparison, all but six were given to the
same person as sheriff and escheator.⁹ After the fall of Middleton, as re-
