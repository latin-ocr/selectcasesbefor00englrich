more than forty years of age.” This clause in every way was thcn of a
clear and uniform writing, not damaged or rased in any place or suspected,
as the said Robert has publicly explained and declared before the aforesaid
council. Moreover the same Robert said that the aforesaid number XL
occurring in the aforesaid clause, so long as it was not rased or damaged, as
has been said, manifestly afforded strong evidence of the weakness and
annulment of the alleged right and title of a certain John Lydeyard ⁸ and
Clemence his wife to and in the aforesaid manors, for in this clause the
number XL, long after the same exemplification was made, has been re-
cently rased and renewed with fresh ink and has been written over, as
stands out very prominently and is clearly apparent in the said inquisition.⁹
By reason of this rasure and rewriting the aforesaid Robert has been greatly
defamed by persons in many parts of the realm who blame him, to the
great shame of the said Robert· and to the enormous prejudice and hard-
ship of the aforesaid Thomas and his aforesaid feoffees in respect of the
right and title to and in the aforesaid mauors. F urthermore the aforesaid
Robert- publicly exhibiting the aforesaid exemplification before the said
council humbly besought in behalf of the king as well as for the restoration
of his own good name that Thomas Smyth,1⁰ clerk, who has custody of the
said inquisition as well as of certain records of the lord the king's chancery
remaining in the Tower of London, under John Frank,¹¹ clerk, keeper of the
rolls of the chancery of the said lord the king, and Robert Poleyn, servant
of the same Thomas Smyth, should be called before the said council to
make recognition of what they know or can say concerning the aforesaid
rasure. The same Thomas and Robert at the aforesaid time and place
appeared before the said council, bringing the aforesaid inquisition that
had been rased as already described, and having viewed the aforesaid in-
quisition at the same time with the aforesaid exemplification, upon the
faith by which they are bound to the lord the king, after mature delibera-
tion they declared and recognised that the aforesaid Robert Poleyn wrote
the said exemplification. Afterward the said Thomas Smyth and Robert
Poleyn examined the aforesaid inquisition together with the said exempli-
fication, whereby they then discovered that in the place of the said rasure
only these letters x and Z had been written simultaneously and originally
for the number forty, which had not been rased, suspected or in any way
impaired‚ just as is written and attested in the said excmplification. Never-
theless because this rasure has been perpetrated falsely and only lately‚ as
it appears, they say that one William Broket with the assistance of a certain
Gerard de la Hay ¹² about St. Katherine's Day ¹³ last came to the aforesaid
