said suppliants have no charter-party because they did not know whether
they would encounter Flemings or Frenchmen upon the sea, and also that
the said suppliants wish to make no suit for the 6 lasts of Hubert Bowman
on account of the forfeiture that he suffered at Weymouth aforesaid, and

Withman Claiston to sue for them as well as for himself. And the said
suppliants will always give good proof by the evidences aforesaid that the
aforesaid merchandise belongs to the said merchants.
