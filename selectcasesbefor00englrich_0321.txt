DANVERs v. BROKET 99

Tower along with the aforesaid Robert Poleyn, and when he had come there
to the room where the said inquisition was kept, as the aforesaid Robert
Poleyn has asserted, the aforesaid William sought to view the aforesaid
inquisition, and when he found this he required (the said Robert) to ex-
amine dive1se other records, while William himself was writing a copy of
the said inquisition. And the said Robert, knowing that the said William
was a clerk in the exchequer of the lord the king and according to custom
had been sworn to the same lord the king, permitted the said William alone
to write a copy of the aforesaid inquisition, while Robert himself was occu-

so that the said Robert well remembers that he never permitted anyone to
have the liberty of making this infamous rasure, excepting only the afore-

Lydeyard concerning the aforesaid rasure and directed to the aforesaid
William after the same rasure had been divulged. Moreover the aforesaid
Robert exhibited certain letters of the same William in reply written by
his own hand, signed xxdth his own seal and directed to the aforesaid John
Lydeyard, concerning the same rasure, which letters, as William himself
believed had come into the possession of the aforesaid John Lydeyard and
not to anyone else. In the copies of these letters written in the name of the
said John, as has been stated, and directed in the aforesaid manner to the
same William, among other things the following clauses occur, to wit in
the first copy: ‘¹ Right welbeloved frende,'' etc. As to this letter and these
clauses the aforesaid Robert produced also a letter of the aforesaid William
in reply written with his own hand and directed to the aforesaid John,
wherein among other things the following clauses occur: “ Reverent and
wurshipfull sir,'' etc. Then the same Robert produced a copy of a certain
other letter written in the name of the aforesaid John and directed to the
said William in regard to the aforesaid rasure. In this copy among other
things the following clause occurs: ‘¹ Ι prei you,'' etc. As to this point the
