⁴⁹ Richard Lacer, or Lacier, Alderman
of London, mercer; witness to a grant of
shops in London in February, 1358 (Close
Rolls, p. 494). His will, dated 25 July,
1361, is in the Calendar os the Coun os H ust-
inq, ii, 59. Richard Lazer is given by Stow
as a variant for Richard Leget, mayor in
1345-46, and may possibly have been the
same man. (Survey, ii, 217.)

⁵⁰ John of Wesenham ‘¹ the king’s mer-
chant ” was an agent employed by Edward
III to take over the money raised as sub-
sicly in Northumberland (Close leons, 15
June, 1355, p. 135), as well as for other
financial transactions (ib. p. 278). He
appears also to have been an exporter of
corn (Pat. Rolls, 20 May, 1357, p. 545) and
in 1360-contracted to provide at Lynn sup-
plies for the victualling of Calais (Close
Rolls, 23 January, p. 607). His transac-
tions with the crown were both on a large
and a varied scale. On 1 February, 1357
he received a year's lease of all the tem-
poralities of the important bishopric of

Ely, ⁴¹ rendering to the king in the Ward-
robe 3540 marks ’' (22493, 6s. 8d.) (Close
Rolls, p. 392). He was in 1357 an owner of
house property in London (Pat. Rolls, p.
636). There is nothing to show that he
was a member of the Mercers’ Company.

⁵¹ John Mayn, the king’s sergeant at
arms, frequently appears in the Close
Rolls and Patent Rolls. He must have
been a man of means, for on 19 December,
1354, the Prior of St. Bartholomew’s,
Smithfield, acknowledges a debt to him of
,840 (Close Roas, p. 99; cf. ib. pp. 78, 324,
&cz and Pat. Rolls, 4 Jan. 1361, p. 150.)
In 1358 he purchased Iands in Surrey from
William de Tudenham (see n. 15, supra).
He was frequently employed to arrest
criminals and bring them before the king
and council (6 March, 1356, Pat. Rozls, p.
395; cf. ib. pp. 450, 496). But he was also
employed in the more serious duty of a
commissioner to inquire into and report on
grievances, as in the case of a complaint
of Venetian merchants against the town
of Bristol on 6 February, 1355, ib. p. 225,
and of a shipwrecked crew against Win-
chelsea, Rye, dte. (ll January‚ 1356, ib.
p. 500). That sergeants at arms had and
