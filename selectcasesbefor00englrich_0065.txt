expressed. The principal grievance was annates, but there was also corn-
plaint of provisions. Fearful of the tendency to encroach upon their rights
of advowson, laymen joined wit-h the clergy in a protest, that “by the un-
bridled multitude of provisions the collation of benefices pertaining of
right to the ordinaries is taken away from them, and at length the poor
nobles and learned men are excluded from ecclesiastical promotion.” ³⁰ The
ensuing Statute of Carlisle, although it failed to state any rule in regard to
provisors, laid down a principle that has been since resterated, that the
ehurches of England had been founded by the king and his progenitors,
and by the nobles and their ancestors, who had given their lands for the
support of religion, and to them the patronage of such churches naturally
belonged.³¹ For a specific statement on provisions we look not to any act
of legislation but to the case before us concerning the treasurership of York.

Now the church of St. Peter's, York, more than any other church in
England had been thrown into the hands of papal provisors. Since 1296,
when the dean Henry of Newerk was promoted to be archbishop, the
deanery was disputed between Cardinal Francis Gaetano a papal provisor
and William Hamilton the choice of the chapter.³² But on this question
the pope in the end gave way. It was different with the treasurership,
which had been held since 1287 by John of Colonna until he was removed
by Boniface VIII in 1296. The voidance of the treasurership happened
during the vacaney of the seey but the king did not immediately claim his
right to the collation, and the pope provided it to Theobald of Bar, a
relative of the king wholly welcome to him. It was not until after Theo-
bald had resigned in 1303, and the pope had named another candidate,
Francis Gaetano, that the validity of these appointments was brought
into question. On 1 November, 1306, the king formally appointed Walter
Bedewynde a clerk of the exehequer to be treasurer of York, and com-
manded the archbishop and chapter to admit him to the office.³³ When
the archbishop failed to obey‚ he was threatened with being called to
answer at the Parliament of Carlisle.³⁴ It is to be noticed in this connection
that the king's right in the matter was asserted before and not after the
meeting of parliament.

The king first sent the matter to be heard by the council at Carlisle.³⁵
Some discussion of it then took place, as certain letters dated 10 March
give us to understand,³⁶ but the full hearing did not take place till after-
wardS. In accordance wit-h the king's writ of 26 April, as our record shows,
the issue was fully stated and argued at length before the council sitting
at London. The special plea of the pope’s legate is that the king has lost
any right to the benefice that he might have had by not exercising it within
