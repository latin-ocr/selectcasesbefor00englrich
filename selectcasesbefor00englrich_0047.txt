was often forthcoming when the person without severity was “ spoken to '’
or “ reasoned vn'thf' It was a severer form when the parties, defendants,
plaintiffs‚ and even witnesses were put under oath or otherwise solemnly
charged to tell the truth and answer whatever might be asked of them. It
was a power-ful weapon in the hands of the court, entirely averse to the
common law, that could thus question a defendant and require him to
incriminate himself. Whenever several co-defendants or witnesses were
examined in turn separately, as in Esturmy v. Courterwy (p. 79), any con-
tradictions or discrepancies in the testimony would easily be noticed. The
admissions or confession of any one could of course be used as information
against the others. The questions were not necessarily prepared in ad-
vance, but were asked informally and adapted to the pliability of the
witness. The aim at all times was to extort coufessions, without which a
condemnation might be of questionable validity.

(3) By a still stricter method, taken over bodily from the ehurch, a set
of questions based upon the allegations in hand was carefully prepared in
advance. These were propounded to the witness singly and his answers
recorded. The case of The Chamberlaz'ns v. Clzesterfield in 1366 ¹ is an early
example of the written questions and answcrs‚ while the Bedford Riot (p.
104) in 1439 affords the most perfect illustration that we have of the kind.
The questions were elaborated and propounded by the court, never, so far
as appears, by the parties to one another. They were put by the chanceilor,
or whoever was presiding at the moment.

As was true of other features of extraordinary procedure, the interroga-
tory examinations were not the exclusive possession of the council and the
chancery. The same method was applied, though not frequently, in the
king's bench, in the exchequer‚ and even in parliament.2 But what was
elsewhere an exceptional expedient, became the common practice of the
council. With some inconsistency, parliament objected to the examinations
as a subversion of the law of the land, making special criticism of the fact
that they were held without record or entry.³ At the same time parliament
did much to encourage the system in individual cases, and even legiti-
matized it in certain statutory offences. This was probably the intent of
the Act 8 Ric. II on false records, wherein the king and council were au-
thorized to proceed “after the manner and form that seemed to them
reasonable.’' The Statute 13 Hen. IV on riots granted that offenders
should be “ put to answer '' and punished by th'e king and council. Again
the Statute 8 Edw. IV on liveries permitted all the courts to proceed “ as
well by examination as by trial.’'

Seldom if ever were the examinations carried on in full council. The
method was peculiarly well adapted to committees which were constantly
