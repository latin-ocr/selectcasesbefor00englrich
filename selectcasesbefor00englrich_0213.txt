marriage with Alan Everard (n. 17, supra).
Cal. os Court os Hustinq, ii, 97.

⁴⁰ There is nothing to show that Wode-
ford or his mainpernors Colwell and Cone-
stable belonged to the Mercers.

¹¹ See Introd. p. lm.

⁴² A witness on 27 January, 1356, to a
conveyance to the king by the Prior of
Bermundeseye, John de Cusancia, of
divers messuages, &c. With him as wit-
nesses were Ellis de Braghyng (n. 45,
infra) and Simon le Plumber os Suthwerk
(n. 44, infra).

⁴³ On 15 October, 1358, Thomas Beket
was commissioned with three others to
make inquisition into the deaths of two
men killed at Malwedon (qu. Manuden),
Essem and to deliver those guilty to the
sheriff at Colchester. Pat. Roas, p. 153.

⁴⁴ Simon Plummer, Plomer, or le Plum-
ber, of Southwark, was a man of note in
that borough. His name appears as a
witness to deeds dated “Suthwerk'' in
July, 1354, January, 1356, and November,

1357 (Close Rolls, pp. 83, 295, 427) . In that
of 1356 the deed was the conveyance of a
reversion by the prior of Bermundeseye to
the king, in that of 1357, a deed of release
of certain lands to the Southwark diocesan,
William de Edyndon, bishop of Winches-
ter. He was returned to parliament for
Surrey in 1360, and again in 1361. (M em-
bers os Parlz'amem, 1878.)

⁴⁵ Elias or Ellis de Braghing, or Braugh-
yngg was evidently on terms of alliance
with Plummer, for he appears with him as
a witness to the deeds of 1354 and 1356
already mentioned and was returned mem-
ber οἱ parliament f or the borough of South-
wark in 1358. (Ibid.)

⁴⁵ In the Patent Roll for 12 May, 1362,
p. 189, is a pardon to Alesia later the wife
of Ralph de Saint Oweyn, a defaulting
debtor to ¹¹ Simon de Reynham, citizen
and mercer of London.''

⁴⁷ One of the mainpernors of Thomas de
Maldon, of London, on 1 θρα, 1357, and
of Thomas Everard on 4 March, 1358.
