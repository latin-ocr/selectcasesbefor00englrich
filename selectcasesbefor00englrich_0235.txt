was between him and master Thomas Gray who was holding his estate, after
which he was against the said Thomas Ughtred in all manner of things
touching the same assize contrary to his promise and contrary to the law of

Also the said sheriff took Robert Walman servant to the said Thomas

[These] are the injuries and wrongs done to John Hotham, knight,
junior,1⁸ by master Thomas Musgrave sheriff 01 York.

First, the said sheriff imprisoned the said John without process of law or
indictment, or 01 any manner of appeal and without warrant and contrary
to law, and the said sheriff held fourteen inquests against him and found no
cause 101 imprisoning him, and the justices of our lord the king [both] of the
peace and of the law, to wit, the lord Percy, master Ralph Neville, master
John Mowbray, master William Finchden, and Roger Fulthorpe held seven
inquests of the knights and more substantial squires in the said county and
could not find anything against the said John Hotham [for which] to im-
prison him. ’

Α180 the said sheriff would not deliver the said John Hotham from the jail
of York until the said John Hotham had found as mainpernors four knights
and one esquire who are under obligation and straitly bound to the said
sheriff, each 101 the whole, in five hundred pounds to bring the body of the
said master John Hotham into the said prison at thjs Pentecost next coming
or within that same time at one month’s notice.

Α180 ¹⁹ the said sheriff counselled the said John Hotham, Simon Heser-
ton, knight,²⁰ and William Cranswick ²¹ to cause themselves to be indicted
by their friends by way of trespass, and 11 they should be so indicted‚ he
would cause them to have an inquest to deliver them from it.
