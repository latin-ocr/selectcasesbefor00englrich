DANVERS v. BROKET ¹

Memorandum quod vicesimo die Iunii anno regni Regis Henrici sexti
post conquestum undecimo quidam Robertus Danvers² personaliter op-
tulit [se consilio domini Regis in] camera stellata in palacio Westm’et ibidem
publice³ exposuit⁴ et declaravit quod circiter duos annos iam elapsos
ipse primo retentus fuit ad essendum de consilio cuiusdam Thom'e Seintcleer
et feoffatorum suorum in hiis que ad legem pertinent de et super jure et
titulo maneriorum de Barton Sancti J ohannis et Staunton Sancti Johannis ⁵
in comitatu Oxon’. Et pro eo quod quedam inquisicio coram Radulfo
Seintowayn⁶ nuper escaetore domini Edwardi, nuper Regis Anglie tercii
a conquestu, in comitatu Surr' anno regni sui [vic]esi1no septimo post
mortem Rogeri de Sancto J ohanne ⁷ capta et in cancellaria sua retornata
probabilis et manifesta iuris et tituli predictorum euidencia exist[ebat] pre-
dictus Robertus ut unus de consilio predicti Thome et feoffatorum pre—
dictorum sequebatur ad concellariam predicti domini Regis nunc pro tenore
ejusdem inquisicionis inter alia sub magno sigillo domini Regis secundum
forman] juris exemplificando. Ac postmodum predictus dominus Rex nunc
tenorem predictum per litteras suas patentes quarum datum est apud West-
monasteriinn terciodecimo die Julii anno regni sui nono inter alia duxit
exemplificari. In quibus quidem inquisicione et exemplificacione adtunc

inter alia continebatur ista clausula:

¹⁰ The 0001011551οο was issued on the
same day. It required also an inquiry
into the complaint of Nicholas Gosselyn
another merchant of Rouen who had lost
6 pipes of wine in the same way. Cal.
Pac. 8 Hen. V, 329.

² Councz'l (md Privy Seal (Exch. T. R),
file 54. The record is exemplified at length
in Close Roll, 11 Ηο0, IV, m. 4d.‚ which
has been used in determining and supply—

ing some of the words. The case was .

known to Coke (Fourch Insl. ch. V), and
was printed in The Kiny‘s Councz'l (p. 525)
without translation or annotation.

² Eldest son of John Danvers of Co-
thorp, of a well established family in
Berkshire and Oxfordshire, trained at
Lincoln’s Inn, of which he became one of
the governors in 1428. From this time on
he was active as an attorney and litigant,

Et quod Petrus de Sancto Johanne

but at the time of this case he was not as
yet in the employrnent of the king. In
1436 he was Justice of the peace 10 Oxford-
shire, and afterwards served frequently as
commissioner and justice os assize. In
1442 he was elected recorder of London
(Cal. Later-booles, K, 273>; 10 1443 110 was
a serjeant at law; in 1444 a king's ser-
jeant‚· in 1450 a justice of common pleas
(Cal. Pae. Rotas).

⁸ Contrary to a current belief, the
proceedings of the council were not al-
ways, perhaps not usually, secret (The
Kiny’s Cozmcil, p. 105). The custom of
public sessions was carried over into the
modern court of star chamber (E. P.
Cheyney, Hist. os Enq. from the Armada,
1, 87).

‘¹ No petition evidently was required.
