lX CASES BEFORE THE KING’S COUNCIL

not clearly explained, John dc Colonna claimed the prebend as a papal
reservation and provision, showing a mandate to the Archbishop of Tours
to induet him.2⁴ The king wrote to the archbishop of Tours inhibiting
him from attempting anything of the kind, and by further letters to Rome
asked for the revocation of the provision in question. “ Even if the king
should submit,” he said at last, “ or permit it to pass, the magnates of his
realm, who are bound by homage and fealty to defend his dignity and
crown, would not allow his right thus to perish.’'²⁵ The provision is not
heard of again. A similar issue, arising out of the claims of rival candidates
to the prebend of Stillington in the diocese of York, came to a judicia] hear-
ing in 1304.2⁶ Different from the case of 1234, the right of the pope was
at this time involved. By reason of the vacancy of the see after the death
of Archbishop Newerk in 1299, the king granted the prebend of Stillington
and the chapel of St. Mary’s to John Bush a clerk of the royal household.²⁷
Almost simultaneously on the ground of a voidance of the prebend created
at the court of Rome, Pope Boniface VIII provided it to his nephew Francis
Gaetano, who apparently held possession during the four succeeding years.2⁸
After a vain attempt to secure the pope's favour toward John Bush, Ed-
ward began the vindication of his own right by a command to Archbishop
Corbridge to admit and induct the clerk into the aforesaid benefices. The
archbishop answered that he could not and ought not to do this against
the act of the pope, whereupon the king called him by writ quare non ad-
misit to answer for contempt before his justices. Since there was no one
who dared to act as his attorney, the archbishop answered in person, re-
peating what he had said before that the act was an act of the pope. The
court pronounced him undefended and seized the temporalities of the see
into the king's hand. Sad and worn the archbishop departed and died
soon after. The same process was then begun against the dean and chapter,
who in sear of the king's wrath admitted the clerk to the chapel but held
the prebend in suspense. By dint of letters inhibiting Francis Gaetano
from attempting anything to the injury of the crown, and by prohibiting
John Bush from answering a citation from Rome,²⁹ the clerk was main-
tained in possession of the prebend of Stillington until 1310, and of the
chapel until 1316. In this case, although the rights of the pope were in
question, the contention was carried on not by the pope but by the arch·
bishop. Moreover it was tried not before the council but before the
justices by a process of common law.

The next case, the Bishop os Sabina v. Bedewynde, was initiated in the
Parliament of Carlisle‚ which met in January, 1307. Here the strongest
sentiments against the papal policy heard for a generation were boldly
