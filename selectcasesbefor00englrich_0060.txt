lVl CASES BEFORE THE KING5S COUNCIL

merchandise had fallen off because of the war with France. No regular
incomes were offered as a substitute, except fines and donations. The
king’s government of the city had its merits, but finance was its weakness.
The aldermon and merchants, upon whom the success of the system de-
pended, were against it, and, as their joint petition suggests (p. 10), were
assiduous in demanding the restoration of their franchised estate.

The first sign of failure carne with the dismissal of the treasurer. Al-
ready in 1294 there was an expression of royal displeasure in a reprimand
administered to the treasurer for not obeying an order of the king to per-
mit a widow to have the goods and chattels of her husband for forty days,
as she should by law and custom.²2 It is commonly said that his fall was
occasioned by the extreme measures taken in collecting the subsidies of
1294. Archbishop Winchelsea complained of his sacrilege in seizing treas-
ure of the churches‚ and the king answered that he had not ordered it
but the trcasurer had done it of his own motion.²³ This may have been
the immediate occasion,24 but the disaffection of the citizens of London
bringing about the failure of one of the king's best calculated plans must
be reckoned as one of the contributory causes. The minister paid a large
sum of money to win back the royal favour, but though he was permitted
to hold his bishopric and to attend parliament as a lord spiritual, he was
never again entrusted with public office or asked to serve on a commission.
The dearest wish of the Londoners that the king would restore to them
their franchises was not immediately granted. For three years more
Edward continued his experiment of holding the city under a warden but
with the restlessness of the citizens and new manifestations of disaffection
on the part of the aldermen‚ the experiment was at length given up. In
1298 in return for a gift of 2000 marks the king restored the mayoralty and
all libertics of the city as freely and entirely as they had been on the day
of his taking them away.²⁵

THE BISHOP OF SABINA v. BEDEWYNDE

The suit of the Bishop os Sabina v. Bedewynde,¹ testing the claims of a
papal provisor, throws light on a subject that has not been sufficiently in-
vestigated. There are the helpful works of Η31161,2 Baier,³ and Mollat,⁴

Continent rather than in England. stubbs has a section which deals almost
