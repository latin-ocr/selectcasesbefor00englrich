LOWESTOFT v. YARMOUTH 69

such within are free to sell and buy herrings and other merchandise at Great
Yarmouth during the fair, yet by the same charter they are . . . can [not]
sell nor buy in the Road of Kirkley nor Lowestoft, nor elsewhere within
seven leagues round the said Yarmouth and so in that degree expressly
contrary to the said statute which wills, etc. and all the rest contained in
their answer is not . . .

The second answer is not an answer to abate the mischief of the [charter],
for it is agreed that people are not conipelled to . . . at Yarniouth . . .
are forbidden . . . to sel] and buy within seven leagues round Yarmouth,
and thereby if a ship or other vessel arrive at the Road of Kirkley which
is within seven leagues it. must go to Yarmouth, or otherwise they cannot
be sold, and thereby the victuals will be worse, which would be too great
damage and mischief to all the commonalty and which should never be
suffered by statute nor by charter for any private profit.

The third answer they have not fully answered, for they have not al-
leged that those who were parties to the said agreement were brought to
answer by process of law and thereby the charter [was] granted contrary
to the agreement, the which is of record and contrary to the law as is above
said by force of inquiries or of office ⁵² to which . . . the parties did not
have their answer it seems that it should be revoked.

As to the fourth answer, their first charter was revoked in solemn form
by good deliberation of all the lords and commons in full parliament ⁵³ as
is abovesaid, and the new charter was never granted by so great advice nor
deliberation ⁵⁴ [so] that it is revocable [and] by right ought to be revoked just
as before the other was for the reason shewn above.

As to the fifth article their answer is not an answer nor a reason, as it
seems that that which is taken at sea and lauded ashore should be re-
strained from being sold by any private persons against the common profit
until that it is landed upon the beach [but] it should be common to all
for their own good, the takers being paid; and as to the allegation that
it would be open forestalling, it is not so, but it would be common
profit, and if there were any such forestalling, it would be chastised and
punished by the common law of the land for that particular act and the
common profit as a whole not thereby interfered with; but so far as they
are restrained from selling and buying their victuals elsewhere than in
Yarmouth‚ this is mischievous and damnifies the whole people, for they of
Yarmouth fix the price and make it clear at their will.⁵⁵

As to the sixth article, they have not replied truthfully, for whereas
they have alleged that the fishermen are able to sell their herring at their
[will] . . . their charter is to the contrary, as is above said, which wills

therefore, substance in the Yarmouth con· royal commissionem, was contrary to the
