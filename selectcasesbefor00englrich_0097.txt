weak, poor, and wasted (degaste) ; and so scarce of people that those who
remained could not support the burdens upon it. The commons, therefore,
pray the king to regrant and confirm its ancient franchises.²⁸

As the fee farm of the town, fixed by King John at ο85539 was at hazard,
always a consideration of moment to medieval treasurers‚ a regrant of the
charter “ according to the rate heretofore '¹ passed the privy seal on 20
February, 1385, to stand until the next parliament.⁸⁰ Since parliament
did not confirm the grant it was revoked as from the meeting of parliamenta
on the 20 October, 1385.ss In little more than a year, however, Yarmouth
again prevailed over its rivals. A charter dated 28 November, 1386, recites
the preceding grants, repeals, etc.‚ and that a petition of the cornmonalty
of England represents that Yarmouth supported greater charges “in the
fortifications and support of the same town against enemies than any other
city or burgh within six counties in circuit next adjoining‚'’ which it would
be unable to continue to do, so “ reduced, impoven‘shed, and wasted '’ was
it, unless its privileges were restored. The charter thereupon annexes
Kirkley Road to Yarmouth‚ revises its privileges as to lading and unlading
ships, etc. The new charter is not provisional. It is expressly stated to
be granted by the assent of the lords upon petition of the conunons‚³² an
official formula of questionable veracity.

Of the case of its opponents the charter naturally says nothing. But
among the petitions to parliament, of the year 1387,³³ is one which is doubt-
less a clerk‘s note of the effect of the petitions he enumerates‚ and runs as
follows: “A nostre seigneur le Roy et a touz les Seigneurs en cest present
Parlement supplient les Communes des Countes de Norfolk, Suffolk, Can-
tebrigge, Huntyngdon, et Bedford, que la Bille q'est livree a nostre dit
Seigneur le Roy et as autres Seigneurs du Parlement par les Burgeys de
Grande Jernemuth ne soit execute a contraire de l'estatut que voet que
chescun lige du Roialme purra franchement achater et vendre en Citees,
Burghes, Portz de Miere etc. ne encountre un repell fait en plein Parle-
ment tenuz a Westminster l’an nostre Seigneur le Roy q'or est quint sanz

sumably lapsed. Gillingwater, p. 121. 11.

³⁰ Cal. Pat. Roas, p. 540. Perhaps this
is the event recorded by Palmer, the
editor os Manship, as follows (p. 336): In
1382 Richard came in person to Yarmouth
and “lykynge verye well thereof, did
graunte them such privileges as before
that tyme had ben by himself revoked
uppon the slaunderous repert os the men
of Leistofteff’ This grant only continued
until the meeting of Parliament in the
following year, when it was abrogated,

it took place, it must have been between
the meeting of Parliament on 7 May and
that on· 6 October. As the latter Parlia-
ment was followed by another on 23
February, 1383, the revised charter must
in any case have enioyed but a very brief
existence, and 1 have failed to find any
notice of it.
