UGHTRED AND OTHERS 2). MUSGRAVE 57

C

These are the injuries and wrongs done to Nicholas Hotham esquire by
master Thomas Musgrave sheriff of York.

First, the said sheriff imprisoned the said Nicholas without process of
law or indictment or of any manner of appeal and without warrant and con-
trary to law, and the said sheriff held fourteen inquests against him, and
found no cause for imprisoning him, and the justices of our lord the king
[both] of the peace and of the law, to wit, the lord Percy, master Ralph
Neville, master John Mowbray⁷ master William Finchden, and Roger Ful-
thorpe held seven inquests of the knights and more substantial squires in
the said county and could not find anything against the said Nicholas [for
which] to imprison him. Also the said sheriff would not deliver the said
Nicholas out of the jail of York until the said Nicholas had found [as] main-
pernor a knight to bind himself for the said Nicholas to the said sheriff in
a hundred pounds ²² to bring the body of the said Nicholas into the said
prison at this Pentecost next coming, or within the same time at one month's
notice. Also the said sheriff counselled the said Nicholas, Simon Heserton,
knight, and William Cranswick to cause themselves to be indicted by their
friends by way of trespass, and if they should be so indicted, he would cause
them to have an inquest to deliver them from it.

Whereupon t-he aforesaid Thomas Musgrave, summoned before the
council touching the premises, says that as to the taking and imprisonment
of the bodies of the said master Thomas, master John, and Nicholas, he
w[ishes] to say that he is sheriff of the county and one of the justices of the
peace. To whom a great outcry daily comes from divers country folk that
folk ride on the high road by day and night, carrying by night fire with
them, threatem'ng folk that they should be burnt if they did not make fines
and ransoms, to wit, some twenty pounds and some ten pounds, and to this
end they made great display; they kindled sparks of fise around their
houses and set- afire and aflame a vat of pitch, wherefore folk of those parts
of the Wold ²⁴¹ were greatly affrighted and often made their complaints
praying remedy and help of the said sheriff and did not dare to abide in
their houses without keeping watch continually at night, twelve or ten men
together, to the great cost and oppression of the pe0p1e; and some were
robbed of great substance, to wit, Walter Cotes of four score and fifteen
pounds and divers other folk whose names are contained in a bill [sewn on
to] these [papers]. [Wherefore the said sheriff wishing to guard the peace as
he was sworn and bound by his allegiance] searched by all methods in his
