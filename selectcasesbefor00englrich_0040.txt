XXXVi CASES BEFORE THE KING'S COUNCIL

“ redoubtablc ”; 1110 address too was likely to be set off in the margin and
ornamented with flourishos of the pen, but these were mere embellishments
101 1110 purpose of inducing attention. The grievance was stated usually
with brcvity, the only elaboration being the horrible nature 01 1110 offence
and the hardship cndured, possibly to the extent 01 exaggeration. In this
point pctitions were apt to fail in giving essential particulars 01 time and
111300. One advantage that a petition had over the 10511111110015 01 common
law was that it might complain 01 “certain 11015005 ’⁷ or “ parties un-
known.'' Evcn a mistake in a name did not invalidate it, e. g. N orton v.
Colynqborne (p. 115). In Poche v. Idle (p. 116) 3 511300 1135 been lest for the
1131110 afterwards to 110 filled in. As the chancellor once remarked, “ in this
court it is not requisite that the bill should 110 10 every point certain (tout
en certein) after the solemnity 01 common law, for here there is only peti-
tion.'' Finally, the prayer was for remedy; it need not specify what
remedy, which in fact was usually left to the court. It concluded with a
pious exhortation, “ for God,’' “ 101 1110 love of God and in the way 01
cha1·ity,'' ‘⁶ we shall pray for you,’' “ 101 1110 sake 01 1110 Queen,'y ete.
Ordinarily the petition was prepared in advance, but sometimes the com-
plainant appeared in court without any petition. Once after proceedings
had begun, a complainant was requested to put her grievances in writing.¹
In some petitions there is internal evidence that they were actually prepared
in court. A late requirement was that petitions should be duplicated one
copy being 101 1110 1150 01 1110 defendant.2 In Arte Wodc v. Clifford (p. 88, n.)
we 310 told that 0110 copy was left 101 3 record with the clerk of parliament,

while the other was given to the clerk 01 1110 privy seal. 'anin in contrast “ s*

an argument against this procedure that it brought in no revenue.³ It was
not 0550111131 101 3 petitiones to appear in pel-som he might be prevented by
poverty (e. g. p. 120). At the same time there was 110 obligation upon the
court to hear a 1101111011, 50 11131 51111015 1051 time and money due to the
delay. F inally 3 written 1101111011 was never a positive requirement. In
several 01 1110 cases, such as'Esturmy v. Cou-rtenay (p. 77) and Danvers v.
Brolcet (p. 97), 3 complainant was permitted to make his charges orally
before the council, and if the facts were thus clearly presented, it sufficed.

χ ’“ ’ Fui-ther, the council took up criminal cases on ‘¹ information ’' or “ sug-

gestion,” by whomsoever it was offered. This was a mode 01 accusation

that was creeping in as the earlier method 01 0111111031 31111031 declined.4 It

differed from the appeal, in that it was unaccompanied by any challenge to

battle; it might be offered either publicly or secretly, and was without

traditional safeguards. There are instances in the time of Edward Ι, 10

which men were put to trial, without indictment, on criminal information,
