xii CAsns BEFORE THE KING’S COUNCIL

known and cited by former historians in the field, by whose work we have
ourselves been guided and assisted. F irst, Sir Edward Coke, the extent of
whose learning has not ceased to cause amazement, in his Fourth I nstitutes,
ch. v, was acquainted with no fewer than fourteen cases prior to the Statute
establishing the Court of Star Chamber in 1487. Each of ‘these cases, with
one. exception, the present editor has succeeded in finding in its original
form; three of them are set forth in this volume, while others have been
published elsewhere. William Hudson, who wrote a treatise on the Star
Chamber, dated 1635, cites two cases of the same period. Also Sir Matthew
Hale, in his Jurisdiction os the Lords' House (1796), a work of enduring
value, has given abundant references to court rolls still unprinted, while
certain volumes of transcripts made under his direction, now in the MSS.
of Lincoln’s Inn, have supplied the earliest case in our collection, besides
pointing the way to others. Nearer to our own time, Sir Francis Palgrave
made a special study of the masses of early petitions, parliamentary and
conciliar, now on file in the Public Record Office. These can best be uti-
lized at present by the aid of the transcripts in sixty-six volumes, intended
by Palgrave for publication. A few of the most striking records contained
in the petitions have been set forth in his brief treatise, The Orz'qz'nal
Authorz'ty os the Kiny‘s Council (1834). Of the great work of Sir N. H.
Nicolas, Proceedirzqs of the Privy Cmmcil (1834—37), the most extensive
collection of this material ever published, it is only necessary to say that it
consists of minutes, for the most part administrative and political, in the
order of business. It contains few cases at length, but many fragments of
judicial proceedings, from which much is to be learned of their character
and methods of procedure. Another work serving as a guide to the original
sources is that of Thomas Madox, History os the Exchequer (1711), which
contains the best digest that has ever been made of the rolls of the excheq-
uer. By the aid of his citations and excerpts at least one of our cases has
been obtained, and the way uncovered for more.

In editing his collection of Select Cases in the Star Chamber (Selden
Society, vol. xvi, 1902), the late Mr. Leadam found among the ffles of Βίαν
Clzczmber Procecdinqs four (lases that came before the king and council prior
to the Act of 1487 on the Star Chamber, and two cases prior to Henry VII.
The thought that there might be others, without which the history of the
subject would never be complete, led to the compilation of the present
volume, which he did not live to finish. “ Until the number and character
os the cases heard before the Council prior to the Act of 1487 have been
definitely ascertained, it would be premature to assert that the public up
to that time had recourse to the Common Law Courts, which they thence-
forth deserted in favour of a tribunal less costly, less hazardous, and more
expeditiouS.’' ¹ Lastly, the present editor, pursuing the subject from an
