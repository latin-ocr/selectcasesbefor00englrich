in maintaining the peace of the Scottish
border. He was the third Baron Percy,
and married as his first wife a great grand-
daughter of Henry III. (G. E. C„ Com-
pleae Peeraye, sub ‘¹ Percy ''.) The name of
his colleague, Ralph Neville, inclines me to
identify him 85 the person here designated.

⁹ Although there appears to have been
a person of these names who may have
been a different individual, I incline to
identify this Ralph Neville with the
fourth Baron Neville of Roby, whose life
is recorded in the Dictionary os National
Bissoyraphy. It is a circumstance not alto-
gether without significance in this con-
nexion that Dugdale, Baronaqe i, 292,
records that in 1331 N eville “ had entered
into an undertaking to serve Henry, lord
Percy, for life in peace or war, except
against the king, with twenty men-at-
arms.’' This lord Percy was the father of
the commissioner of this document and
died in 1352. The Patent Rolls afford
numerous instances of the association of
Ralph Neville with, but ranking after,
Henry Percy, as upon commissions of the
peace for Yorkshire (Cal. Pat. Rolls, 20
March, 1361, 64, 292) and Northumber-
land (ib. pp. 65, 453), commissions of
oyer and terminer for Cumberland (ib.
p. 148) 81111 Yorkshire (4 May, 1364, pp.
539, 540, 541; cf. Close Roas, 10 June, 1364,
p. 57). Ralph Neville died 5 Aug. 1367. He
was an active and distinguishedsoldier on
the Scottish border (see Dici. N at. Βίας).

The difficulty 1811181115, however, that the
style “ monsieur '' is used. This can
scarcely, however, have indicated his
third son, Ralph Neville, who was born
not earlier than 1343, 1115 eldest brother
John being aged twenty-six on the death
of his father in 1367, and who would there-
fore have been only about twenty-three in
1366. The next name, that of a judge‚
suggests that the first two commissioners
were men of high rank.

¹⁰ John Mowbray, whose connexion
with the noble family of Mowbray or
Moubray Foss was unable to discover,
was in practice as an advocate as early 85
1343 81111 in 1354 was a king's serieant-at-
law. At this time he was a justice of com-
mon pleas, to which office he had been
raised in 1359, and a knight of the Bath.
The fre-quency with which he was em-
ployed as 11 commissioner of oyer and ter-
miner, especially in the county of York,
will be apparent at 8 glance in the Patent
Rolls. William Fyncheden and Roger Ful-
thorp were frequently associated with him
in these cases and similar inquiries.

¹¹ William Fyncheden may be con—
jectured to have been of a Yorkshire
family, a Richard Fyncheden being ap-
pointed a commissioner of array for that
count-y in 1359. His name occurs as an
advocate in the Year Books from 135ος 111
1362 he was made 8 king's serjeant, and
was employed as a iustice of assize in 1364.
On 29 October, 1365, he was appointed 8.
