CXlV CASES BEFORE THE KING’S COUNCIL

cation, the concinet of Lord Fanhope and his followers was not without
excuse, and that the justices had most likely been aetuated by motives of
11131100 and anger. Thus they reported to the king, who commanded the
chancellor 10 issue a patent of pardon and release 101 Lord Fanhope and
all his followers. For a record which his lordship desired, these letters
dated 7 Μ31011 with an abstract of the case were exemplified on the Patent
Roll.⁹

But the vindication of Lord Fanhope was not satisfactory to his op-
ponents, who then took steps toward getting a similar vindication for them-
selves. By letters patent dated 30 May, Wauton and his fellows, together
with a host of 111011 who had participated on their side in the riot of 12
January, were pardoned and released of all fines, sureties and other obliga-
tions 111 regard to the matter.¹⁰ In the exact words used in the release of
Lord Fanhope, it was declared that the certification against them had been
made of inere mallee. Thus in the midst 01 1011(18 and strifes‚ that were
leading directly toward civil war, the king and council temporized. With
all the solemnities of legal procedure, they sought to do justice neither
to one side nor the other. They did not even support one party against the
other 3 but without any intelligent policy they released one band of rioters
and then the other, 101 110 other gain than the paltry sees paid into the
chancery. It is not surprising to learn that judicial sessions in Bedford-
shire were soon again disturbed.¹¹

HEYRON v. PROUTE

The suit 01 H eyron υ. Proute, 1460—63, is a single stage of a litigation that
was afterwards carried from court to court during a period 01 twenty years.
From a passage in the chionicles 01 Fabyan 1 we 103111 that it originated in
a mysterious loan of .,τῗ18,ΟΟΟ1 which the staplers of Calais advanced to the
Yorkist lords while they were making the town their stronghold in 1459-60.
When the staplers in 1462 approached Edward IV 101 3 return 01 the money,
they were answered by the council that the loan had never come to the
king's knowledge, but belonged of right to the 0311 01 Wiltshire the treas-
urer lately beheaded for treason. Fabyan says that it was this Richard
Heyron, described as “of pregnant wit and of good manner of speech‚”
who brought forward at this time the claims of the staplers. But Heyron
was speaking for none but himself, 101 1110 present record shows that al-
ready in the reign of Henry VI he had turned against his fellow staplers,
and was seeking by devious courses to gain satisfaction and, as events
prove, to wreak vengeance on his enemies.
