INTRODUCTION xvii

He might be of the council for life, “ for the time,'' or, ‘¹ especially ap-
pointed.’' Likewise he might give or be asked for his “advice ” or ‘¹ opinion‚’'
but was not said to “ vote.” Moreover the king’s council was intended to
consist not of a single class of couneissors, but “ of all conditions of men,
like another parliament, spiritual and temporal‚ nobles and lawyers com-
mon ἅ civil, and so fit to discern, order & dispose of all things in the uni-
versal government.” ¹ Unlike parliament there was no particular class or
estate which might claim to be included in the council. The statement that
‘¹ the king summons whom he wills to his councils '’ was here the effective
mle. (Now the justices, in the time of Edward I, were regularly sworn of
the council; they attended its meetings when summoned and rendered
their advice. Sometimes they acted jointly with the lords spiritual and
temporal, as a lesser estate.² Often in the treatment of legal questions they
were the only councillors in attendance.³ On one occasion an investigation
was being held before the justices in first instance, and afterwards there
were present others “ of more importance.’' 4 From the time of Richard II,
when the influence of the lords was more powerfully felt, the tendency was
to reduce the position of the justices and other officials still further. Their
attendance was henceforth occasional and their participation limited to
matters of judicial character. Unless it were in the inchoate court of chan-
ccry, the council was never left solely to its judicial attendants„ Still by
acts of parliament the attendance of the justices was required and their
advice was to be asked for in all legal questions. In the case of Atte Wode
v. Clifford (p. 91), it is shown how their advice was sought upon the final
form of the record. Again it is recorded how they were asked individually
for their opinions. They were no less truly king's councillors because they
stood on a different plane from the lords and knights. They were also
specially serviceable in the committees of examination, of which more will
be said. Such was the status claimed at a crisis by the justices themselves,
who declared that they were the “ king’s councillors in law‚” but were not
to be considered such ‘¹ between party and party '' ; ⁵ in other words they
were to state the law but not to give judgment. Whether the justices and
other officers then were members or advisers, it seems sufficient to say in
the sage words of Sir John Fortescue, “ they be of this council when they
be so desired, else not.”

At all times the council served as a body of vconsultation and advice for =
the justices in any legal difficulty. This practice is perhaps traceable to the
act of Henry II in 1178, requiring the justices of the bench then appointed,
whenever any question should arise which they could not decide by them-
