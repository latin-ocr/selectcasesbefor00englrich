CITIZENS OF LONDON v. THE BISHOP OF BATH 16

themselves. This 1110 110 led until our lord the king of his grace deliv-
ered him. Moreover the said bishop took from him all his goods to the
value of 3200, and he has never been able to obtain the half 01 it;
also the said bishop sent men such as were of his livery to be on a jury
to take the said Matthew and put him to death, (causing him) grave
damages of ε131000.

Ralph Sansauver prays 101 the grace 01 our lord the king, that whereas
he was assigned to go with Sir Edmund the king's brother to Gascony‚⁵4 the
said Ralph by favour of the king remained in the retinue of Sir William of
Breus⁵⁵ under certain covenants to go 101 him to Gascony. That is, taking
from him 3100, for which Ralph received 5:60 and two horses. And
because the horses were not sufficient, he ought to have had 10 marks more.
And at the suit 01 Sir William Ralph was brought to court before the
treasurer and barons 01 the exchequer, to respond to the aforesaid Sir
William for the 5360 and two horses. Since Ralph was ancl is always
ready to keep all kinds 01 covenant with my lord William, he therefore
responded before the treasurer and barons 01 the exchequer. Thereupon
they gave judgment that Sir William should recover the §60 and the two
horses or 50 marks. And because Ralph was always ready to perform every
covenant with Sir William without defauit or r'emissness, as they can see,
he prays 101 remedy in respect of this judginent which seems to him harsh
and arbitrary.

Taken by force of the treasurer without tally or writing or payment the

2 gowns of arms ⁵⁷ worth 30 shillings, 2 targets ⁵⁸ worth 16 shillings, and
a. pair of arm-pieces of whalebone ⁵⁹ covered with white sendal together
with gauntlets to match worth 40 shillings, and 5 pairs of gauntlets of
plate worth 33s. 4d. Sum of 299 l9s. 4d.

⁶⁰ This same William shows to ‚our lord the king complaining against the
treasurer that the said William had by gift 01 the aforesaid Philip 6 acres of
pasture outside 01 London, where the said William had placed 11 1101505 to
grass worth 300 marks, and the said treasurer had these horses seized to
the use of the king, taking and delivering them to Roger Mouhaut, so that
the said William could never have money for his horses, whereby he has
been impoverished. He therefore prays the grace of our lord the king to
afford remedy.

This same William complains of the said treasurer that whereas the said
William had purchased two horses with hay for the use of the king 101
«13116 and 1 mark, the treasurer distrained him 01 the „4316 and the mark, so
that it is incumbent upon the said William to pay this money to the mer-
