LOWESTOFT v. YARMOUTH 64

Also when the herring pass into private hands thus by constraint or
pretext of the king's charter the herrings are the dearer because the said
private persons 5611 the herrings at their will.

Also whereas divers pedlars and carters of the counties of Suffolk,
Cambridge, Oxford‚ Hunfingdon, Bedford, Buckingham, Northampton,
Leicester, and Essex were accustomed to come to the parts of Suffolk and
Norfolk at their will without coercion and there to buy herring to victual
the said counties‚ the said counties are not now victualled by the said ped-
lars and cartem, for the reason that the said pedlars and carters will not be
able to come to the said town of Yarmouth because they must make two
passages towards the said town of Yarmouth at great costs and charges.

Also our lord the king has granted to the said bailiffs and burgesses his
customs duty in the said Road and has annexed the same Road to the
haven of Yarrnouth and that for a hundred shillings to be yearly p'aid to
him, because of which gift ²⁰ certain folk of Yarmouth keep there a barge
manned with four score armed men to make war so that no vessel is able
to put in there, to have which custom the Lowestoft tenants of our lord
the king (and so that all people should be able to buy and sell there) would
give ,4320 yearly to the king.²¹

Also certain people of Yarmouth bring action against the Lowestoft
tenants of our said lord the king ²² in divers of the king's courts ²³ for what
ought to be done in the said Road the which if it be in any county is in the
county of Suffolk, and upon pretext of the said charter they try (them) by
Norfolk people and condemn them in great sums, to wit, some in ‚4340 and
some in 40 marks, which they will not be able to bear. This against the
law of the land that people of one county should try anything done in an-
other county‚²4 so that the said tenants of the king there by such falsities
are well-high destroyed and the commons of the realm greatly 1111-
povcrished for the reasons abovesaid if the said charters be not repealed.

C ANSWER OF YARMOUTH

1380 These are the answers to certain articles comprised in a bill promoted
by cert-ain persons to set aside and repeal the charter of Yarmouth, which
articles with the answers follow in the following form:

mesne. (See E. Coke, 4 Ιηεί., pp. 269-
270.) Hence, the men of Lowestoft were
the king’s tenants.

’ὅ Legal proceedings had been carried on
at intervals since 1373. See an indictment
of that year by Yarmouth against Lowes-
toft men in Swinden, p. 615.

²⁴ This was probably good law. Glan-
ville, it is true, says (xiii, 6), “Ab initio
eligendi sunt duodecim liberi et legales
homines de visineto,'⁷ writing of the iury
of possaesory assizes. In the Articuli su per

Charias of 28 Ed. I, the sheriff or bailiff
shall put on a jury for trying an issue be·
tween-king and subject, or between party
and party, “16(5) plus procheins ‘⁴' (E.
Coke, 2 1ηεί. 560, 561). Hence, the Hun-
dredors who in the time os Ed. III regu—
larly numbered s‘ut (Blackstone, Comm.
iii, c. 23) which implies Hundredors of
one county. In the time of Fortescue,
this number had fallen to four (De Laud-
ibus, c. xxv). Under Elizabeth, it was de-
termined by all the judges that the juror
