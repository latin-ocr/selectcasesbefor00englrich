liamento.¹ It was not necessary that the lords should participate in all the
acts of the council or of other courts; their mere presence lent dignity, not
to say authority, to all that was done. In one instance an appeal in parlia-
ment was heard, as the record states, “before the chancellor, the treasurer,
the justices of both benches and others of the council ”; ² the lords appar-
ently took no part, but the proceedings were none the less in parliament.
Whatever was begun in parliament and continued afterwards before the
council was likely to be given the same general sanction. In the case of
Rex v. Gerdeston (p. 27) the parliament closed on 9 March, 1315, and the
hearing was begun on the following 30 April, yet for some reason that is not
evident it was said to have been heard before the council in parliament.
We have several cases of the kind, which therefore failed of being entered
upon the Parliament Rou. The theoretical rather than the actual presence
of parliament is illustrated by a singular incident that occurred in 1397.³ A
certain suitor on his way to court was waylaid by his opponents and foully
murdered in Fleet Street, London; the deed was considered especially
atrocious because it was done “ in the presence of the king and the whole
parliament.'' It is true, parliament was sitting at the time, but not in
Fleet Street. Our records will shew that at any stage a case before the
council might be treated in parliamentary session without change in the
character of the proceedings beyond the manifest advantages of larger
attendance, wider discussion and stronger sanction. Parliament was
indeed slow to regard the council as a court distinct from itself. In the
incident just cited the suit was said to be pending “in parliament and
before the council.'' Our case of Aue Wode v. Clifford, which was formally
referred by parliament to the council (p. 88), indicates how this line of
demarcation carne to be drawn.

For an indefinite time the branch of the curia reqis known as the court
coram reye, or the king's bench, was of similar elasticity. Unlike the court
of common pleas, which was founded for a specific purpose, it retained the
traditions of the time when the king's court was a general assemblage of
barons and officers. In the time of Henry ΙΙΙ its sessions were usually
before the appointed justices, and in this light it was defined by Bracton,⁴
but in the same roll pleas before the council alternate with pleas before the
justices without material change either in the character of the court or the
pleas themselves. Moreover a case before the justices might become a case
before the council not by an appeal or changebof venue, but by a postpone-
ment until the council, possibly the council in parliament, should assemble.
Our first case, Boistard v. Cumbwell (p. 1), in dealing with the claims of a
foreigner, shows why the presence of a conciliar body was desired. Some-
times the council under these conditions included lords in indefinite number;
sometimes there is reason to say it was nothing more than a conference of
