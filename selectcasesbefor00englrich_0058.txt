llV CASEs BEFORE THE KING’s COUNCIL

either ignored or evaded by legal fictions. In some of the examples before
us, we can see the pretexts upon which these actions were taken. John
Bone (p. 17) had made a recognizance on record in the exchequer of his
debt to Adam of Stratton. After Stratton had been convicted of crime
and his property confiscated, all debts due to him fell to the crown, and
Bone was called before the treasurer to answer for the debt. Again Ralph
Sansauver (p. 16) was bound by certain covenants of military service to
William of Brewes; presumably Brewes was under obligations of military
service to the king, so that the exchequer was induced to enforce a debt
due to a dcbtor of the king. In the case of Roger Paw (p. 13) it is alleged
that a merchant whose wool had been confiscated by the king straightway
sued his agents for the money spent in purchasing it. A reason for the
distrust of the exchequer in this regard is expressed in the fifth petition,
that the actions ‘¹ are commenced by bill and not by writ of the king.” A
court that proceeded only by writ was under the control of the common
law, but a court that could proceed upon a suitor’s petition was under no
such restraint. This was the kind of authority that was granted to the
itinerant justices, not in all cases but at least in cases of very poor people.¹³
It was an authority later grasped by the chancellor, and was always the
distinctive power of the king's council. But no such position was con-
ceded to belong to the exchequer. There was a prolonged struggle before
the exchequer was forced to release its hold upon pleas belonging to the
common law.¹‘³ In the Ordinances 5 Ε(1. II, c. 25, it was declared that
pleas in the exchequer should be limited to those affecting the king and
the Officers of the exchequer, their attendants, and servants, and any
parties wrongly impleaded might have recovery in parliament.

The reason for suitors desiring to collect their debts through processes
of the exchequer is seen especially in its free use of the power of distraint.
No complaint of the time is more often repeated than that against exces-
sive distraints, by which for a petty debt to the king or another a party
might in a moment be deprived of all or much of his property. Thus ac-
cording to the allegation of John of Gisors (p. 9), because he was unwill-
ing to submit to the jurisdiction of the exchequer over a free tenement in
the city, he was by this means forced to make peace with his opponent.
The citizens of London argued that since it was one of their liberties to
deraign themselves in pleas of the crown, so they should be permitted to
clear themselves of distraints issuing from the exchequer. To check the
abuse there were many acts of legislation like the following: On producing
a tally of payment, distress shall cease; distress shall be reasonable after
the value of the debt, not outrageous; distress for the king's debts shall
not be made up of beasts of the plow, so long as one may find other, and
