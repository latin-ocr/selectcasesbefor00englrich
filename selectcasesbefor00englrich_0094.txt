XC CASES BEFORE THE KING'S COUNCIL

so laden or discharged were the property of the person so lading or dis-
charging. “ All letters granted to the town of Lowestoft‚ or to the men of
the same,'y were by the same instrument revoked.

This interference with the course of trade, the diversion of which from
Yarmouth was beneficial to Lowestoft, naturally provoked resentment.
It ran counter to the general policy of parliament, which in 1351 had passed
a statute affirming the principle of unrestrict-ed trade, “notwithstanding
any francfflses, grants, or custom used . . . to the eontrary.’' ⁴ In 1376
a petition was presented to the king by the counties of Suffolk, Essex,
Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire, Lincolnshire, Northamptonshire, Bed-
fordshire⁷ Buckinghamshire, and Leicestershire praying for a restoration of
liberty so far as the herring trade was concerned.⁵ In response to this, the
annexation of Kirkley Road to Yarmouth was revoked ⁴³ (24 April, 1376).

In the following year (1377) an inquisition ad quod damnum was sent
out by the town of Yarmouth alleging its inability to pay the crown dues
and taxes unless its franchises were restored.⁷ Upon this, a eommission of
inquiry which had been issued by Edward III and his couneil, but which
had lapsed with his death, was revived.⁸ Presumably upon the report of
this commission, the matter came before the couneil, during the ascendency
of John of Gaunt, Duke of Lancaster, on 6 April, 1378, “ and consideration
had of the losses sustained by the town,⁹ and the further damage which,
if it were left desolate, might arise on a sudden invasion by the king's
enemies,'' a provisional order was made that Yarmouth should again en-
joy its franchises in Kirkley Road until the next parliament.¹⁰ In the
meanwhile a fresh inquiry was to be instituted by a more important body
consisting of seven connnissioners, headed by the earl of Suffolk. These
were insti-noted to visit Kirkley Road, Yamiouth, and Lowestoft and
to certify the king and council at the next parliament, which met on
20 October, 1378, at Gloucester. On 7 October of that year the com-
missioners had sat at Yarmouth and on the following day at Lowestoft.
They reported that Yarmouth was a place of defence, while Lowestoft
was uninelosed, and that it would be for the public advantage that
Yarmouth should have its charter restored.¹l It is certain that the
Parliament of Gloueester was adverse to the class of privilege asserted
by Yarmouth.¹² It was also strongly opposed to John of Gaunt. The
