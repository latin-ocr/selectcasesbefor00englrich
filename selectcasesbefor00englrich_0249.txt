Lownsror'r v. YARMOUTH 63

Also by good deliberation of the lords of England in the time of the said
grandfather the thirty-second year of his reign ¹⁵ it was agreed among the
people of Yarmouth and the people of the Cinque Ports ¹⁷ and the Lowes-
tost. tenants of our lord the king, because that the said bailiffs and burgesses
of Yarmouth would sue to have had such a charter as they have now,
whereas the agreement taken before the said king and his council that in
time of fair all people shall be able without impeachment to buy and sell
in all the vessels that wish to anchor in the said Road, which agreement is
of record in the Chancery and exemplified under the king's seal, which
agreement is defeated by the charter granted to them, being the said
charter in its force.¹8

Also before this time by good deliberation of all the lords and commons
in full parliament their charter was repealed for profit of the king and com-
mons of the land as was then shewn and proved in the said parliament.¹⁹

Also whereas by gift of God the ships which take herring put in at
Kirkley Road near the said town of Lowestoft and that which has been
taken at sea the merchants and mariners of the said ships in reason and
good saith ought to sell and to land their merchandise at their will, and in
case that the said bailiffs and burgesses have a charter that all the ships
ought to come to Yarmouth against the wish of the mariners it is against
reason and good saith and the common profit.

Also as before this time the said bailiffs and bmgesses of Yarmouth had
such a charter that all the ships entering Kirkley Road charged with mer-
chandise and herring that wished to sell their merchandise and herring
there must come to Yarmouth against the wish of the masters [and] mari-
ners and great damage and loss come fron] this because that when the
wind was in the East, North or Northeast or Northwest quarter no manner
of ship could enter in the said haven of Yarmouth and thereby that the
mariners could not sell their merchandise to others at their will, the herring
were spoilt and thrown at times into the sea by the mariners to the great
loss of the commons of England‚ by which mischief there has been great
dearness of herring and yet shall be is other remedy be not ordained for the
cause aforesaid.

Also because that the mariners are constrained so that they shall not
be able to sell their herting in those parts to others than to those of Yar-
mouth and that at their will, because of which constraint all the alien
mariners take their herring to their own countries and thus there is great

deamess of herring in these parts and ever shall be if other remedy be not
ordained.
