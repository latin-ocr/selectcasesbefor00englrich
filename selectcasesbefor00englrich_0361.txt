FOUQUIRE v. meone 119

Most humbly beseecheth William F ouquire, a poor labourer dwelling in
the town of Rouen, how on Holy Thursday of the year fourteen hundred
and thirty . . . last passed, the said suppliant and two merchants of Eng-
land, one named John Nicole and the other Stephen Nicole, then dwelling
in the parish of Brixham a half-league from Dartmouth, as they said, had
come together in a certain place in the town of Rouen, and because the said
suppliant had not the means wherewith to support his wife and children,
he had contracted with the said (John and Stephen) Nicole to deliver three
children to the said (John and Stephen) Nicole, that is, two sons, one
named Geoffrey and the other Gervaise, and a daughter named J aquelot,
to serve the said (John and Stephen) Nicole for a certain time; that is, the
said Geoffrey and Gervaise for the space of seven years then following,
(John and Stephen) fumishing them their necessaries and keeping them in
school for two years by way of compensation, during which two years ‘the
aforesaid daughter was to serve the said (John and Stephen) Nicole.⁵ And
after the completion of the said seven years- by the said children and two
by the said daughter, (John and Stephen) Nicole were to send them back
to their home in the said town of Rouen, (just) as these things are set
forth in letters under the scal of the bailliage of Rouen, which bears the
same. After which things the wife of the said suppliant, the mother of the
said children, has died and her inheritance has come to the said children, of
which many of their relatives have wanted or want possession, alleging that
the said children are dead. Wherefore the said suppliant has come here
hoping to have his children peaceably‚ and he has found that the said John
Nicole has died meanwhile and the said Stephen, son of the said John
Nicole, and the wife of the latter will not retum the said children but have
wished to sell them, and have told the said suppliant that he should not
have his children at all unless he paid eighteen nobles‚⁶ which (thing) is con-
trary to right and reason and the promise of the said (John and Stephen)
Nicole and to the utmost grief, prejudice and damage of the said children,
who have not been to school at all, as has been said. May it please your
benign graces, having considered these things, to show reason and justice
to the said suppliant and cause his children to be returned by the said
Stephen and his father’s widow, just as they are bound to do, so that the
said children may be able to recover their inheritance which comes to
them from their mother and their father, when the case requires, and that
the said suppliant their father may be able to make of them their profit
and his own,⁷ just as natural right and reason permit. Hereupon grant

was necessary to bring the children into strict sense of the word ‘represented'
court, for the father could not act as their before the court by his guardian even if he
attorney. “ An infant can sue: he sues has one. . . . A friend of the infant may
in his own proper person, for he can not sue out a writ and bring the child into
appoint an attorney. He is not in any court. But the action will be the infant’s,
