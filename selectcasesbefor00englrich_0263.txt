them never to sell within the seven leagues, etc.; and as to the allegation
that the ships could come into the port of Yarmouth in whatever quarter
the wind may be, that cannot be done in a great storm, as they themselves
say, nor can they be brought by such vessels as are called lighters any
the more without great and excessive peril, and it is agreed that [if] they
could be brought by such vessels, it would be with very great losses and
toils on the part of the mariners and merchants and other commons and
great disturbance to the fishermen.

As to the seventh article the mariners are free to go at their will with
their herrings‚ etc. . . the complaint, the complaint is that the mariners
are constrained so that they cannot sell their herrings to others than to
those of Yarmouth . . . that they are free to go, etc„ in which place when
the wind serves them, etc. This does not prove that they are not con-
strained . . . [when] they come into that part they are constrained as will
be proved by their own answer and confession.

As to the eighth article they have alleged nothing to abate the mischief
. . . for whereas the herrings . . . channel in the said Road those of
Yarmouth take them despite their . . . at their will . . . .

As to the ninth article . . . Yarmouth . . . parts of Suffolk we say
that they have alleged nothing to abate the mischief for . . . is . . . many
of Suffolk as for other commons of the reahn‚ we pray therefore that they
may be . . . other commons . . . count-ies whereas they say that pedlars
and other victuallers could come to Yarmouth to buy it . . . places and
. . . no inconvenience . . . we say that for them to come there is at
great eost and inconvenience except that they buy . . . that they ought
not in the hands of the said mariners to the great harm of the country with
the whole neighbourhood and these are the losses . . . by which . . . king
and his council.

As to the tenth article whereas they say that herrings sold in the said
Road and the vessels out of which the . . . [herrings] . . . [is] sold are
forfeitable‚ it seems that this would be evidently contrary to the said
statute which wills that every liege of the realm should be free to sell ⁵⁶ . . .
to assign expressly a cause of forfeiture, and thus until their act with the
armed men for . . . manner of right, and thereby their charter granted
on contrary terms [is] revocable. And as to their statement that besides
granting a fair to . . . would be dangerous and burdensome to Yarmouth,
they say that they ask no fair but ask that they . . . sell and buy . . .
ordains that every liegeman of the reahn shall be able according to the
form and the . . . also we ask the custom of the Road that . . . ever
belonging to the said town of Yarmouth before their new charter which
was made in the forty-sixth year of the grandfather [of the king] ; ⁵⁷ to have
which custom we will give . . . twenty pounds yearly ⁵⁸ which would be
a great augmentation to our lord the king and to the great improvement
of the whole realm.
