lxxxviii CASEs marom: THE KING⁷s COUNCIL

It is particularly unfortunate that in this case the judgment of the council
is so mutilated that only its general tenor can be arrived at; that is, a con-
demnation of the sheriff in damages, and a vindication of the innocence of
Ughtred and the Hothams. What makes the defects the more lamentable
is that the date of the judgment does not appear. The only date we have
is 19th April, 1366, the “ quindene '’ on which the petitione were filed.
Parliament in this year met on 4 May, and was dismissed a week later,
The receivers and triers of petitions were nominated on the opening day.
There do not appear to have been any definite limitations of time for the
sittings of the council as a judicia] tribunal. But we know that, as early
as 1426, the traditional practice, followed at a later date by the Star Cham-
ber, was to sit in term time.³⁰ Nor is there any reason to suppose that in
1366 the transaction of judicial business by the council was any less expe-
ditious than it appears to have been at the end of the fifteenth century.31
Now in the year 1366, Easter Term began on 22nd April and ended on
4 June ; while the succeeding term, Trinity term, began on 10 June, and
ended on 1 July. If, therefore, this case was tried with such dispatch as
there is some reason to assume, the judgment was probably delivered by
or before the last mentioned date. But the displacement of Musgrave on
13 May indicates that it reached a speedier hearing.

The need for dwelling upon this point will now be seen. In the Patent
Roll of 26 October, 1366,32 occurs the following entry, remarkable in view
of the judgment before us. “West1ni11ster,'Oct. 26. Pal-don to Thomas
Oughtred ‘chivaler‘ indicted before John Knyvet and his fellows, justices
of Oyer and Terminer in the County of York, of having, with other thieves
unknown, robbed William Randexnan of Richemond at Balderly ‘in the
Brome’ of 100 s. of silver and a horse with 20 s. on Thursday after All Saints
in the 31st year ; ³³ of having, with others unknown, robbed Alexander de
Barton at Buttrehowe by F lawath of 5:14 in gold and silver and a horse
worth 20 s. on Tuesday after the Epiphany in the thirty-ninth year ;³⁴ and
of having, with others unknown, robbed Peter, servant of Haynekyn
Weland, at Polles in the forest of Galtres, of a horse and a bundle of wollen
cloths of scarlet and other striped cloths, on Tuesday after Martinmas in
in the twenty-sixth year ³⁵ of the king's suit for the said robberies and
felonies, and of any consequent outlawries.

Afterwards, on 30 October following, Thomas de Beverlee, William de
Dalton, Robert de Garton, Thomas de Wilton, and William de Brunby of
