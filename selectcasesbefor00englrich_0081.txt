INTRODUCTION lxxvii

in 1322, the successes of Edward II over the barons turned the tables in
favour of the foreign merchants, and their old privileges were restored.
The wrath of the Londoners blazed forth. The Italians, on this and other
grounds, particularly odious‚ were attacked, and the houses of the Com-
pany of the Bardi plundered and burnt.⁶ In 1326 the freedom of the City
was withdrawn from all aliens.⁷

A partial reaction followed. In 1335 parliament laid down the principle
of liberty of trade to aliens as established by the Carta M ercatorz'a. The
preamble of the statute of that year ⁸ recites that general complaints had
been made “ that in divers cities, boroughs, ports of the sea, and other
places of his (the king’s) realm, great duress and grievous damage have
been done to him and his people by some people of cities, boroughs‚ ports
of the sea, and other places of the said Realm, which in long time past have
not suffered, nor yet will suffer merchant strangers, nor other, which do
carry and bring in by sea or land wines, Aver de pois,⁹ and other livings and
victuals, with divers other things to be sold, necessary and profitable for
the king, his prelates, earls, barons, and other noblemen, and the commons
of this realm, to sell or deliver such wines, livings‚ victuals, nor other
things to any other than to themselves.’' The consequence is alleged to
be an enhancement of price to the injury of the consumer.

As a reme-dy for these mischiefs, freedom to sell was granted to the alien
merchant and forfeiture of franchise denounced against the borough con-
travening this principle, while any person guilty of “ disturbing ’⁷ such
merchant was punishable with double damages, a year’s imprisonment,
and a fine to the crown. One concession of importance‚ however, was not
regranted, that of liberty for aliens to trade by retail.¹⁰ That step was
taken in 1351,¹¹ when retail trade was thrown open, “ notwithstanding any
franchises, grants, or eustom used‚’⁷ to the traders enumerated in the Act
of 1335. Probably on account of the opposition excited, it was thought
necessary to confirm the principle in a statute of 1353.¹² Other statutes for
the encouragement of foreign traders were passed about the same time.¹⁸

In the light of these events, the exasperation felt by the citizens against
those aliens who were specially engaged in retail dealings, as were the
Lombard mercers, becomes intelligible. It must be understood that the
mercer at that date was by no means restricted to a trade in silk goods.
