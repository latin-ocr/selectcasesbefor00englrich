must adjourn because the attestations were in the hands of the sub-admiral
who was then in distant parts. At one point of the proceedings the record
was taken to the chancery on writ of certiorari. Whether the case ever
came to a final judgment is not known.l Another case, begun about 1389,
was carried through twenty-nine sittings, interrupted several times by
appeals to the council on questions of authority, until in 1404 the record
was ordered by a certiorari to be sent to the chancer-322 Under these condi-
tions it is not strange that the jurisdiction of the admiralty throughout the
fifteenth century continued to be contracted rather than expanded, while
still other courts were being fashioned for receiving 3 share of the cases of
international and commercial character.

As a result, the principal part of this jurisdiction remained just where it
had been from the beginning, primarily in the king's council, secondarily
in the chancery. Parties illegally sued in the admiral’s court under the
statutes might recover damages, and thus the way was open for appeals
from the court of admiralty on the ground that it was acting in violation of
the statutes and in excess of its authority, or as it was usually stated that
the judgment was “ contrary to the law and the form of the court.'’ The
council listened to such appeals and in various ways showed itself distrust-
ful of the judicial capacity of the admirals or their deputies. It was quick
to interfere wit-h the admiralty by orders to stay proceedings; sometimes it
dictated to the admirals leaving them little independence of judgment; on
one occasion it summoned the admirals to answer for their conduct. A case
was heard in 1386 wherein the admirals were made defendants of their
conduct in rendering a judgment, which was then reversed by a decision of
the council.³ Rather than run the risks attendant upon the court of
admiralty, suitors might better seek redress in first instance from the king’s
council. As for foreigners, the count-il was their only recourse, until the
chancellor also was permitted to hear them. This condition was far from
satisfactory, for manifestly the council could not hear many of the cases
presented or even give them passing attention. According to a complaint
of the commons in 1439 it was likely to err on the side of leniency. At the
suit of alien merchant-s, it was said, made before the king and council,
sometimes before the chancellor, ships captured from the enemy were re-
leased and damages paid, to the injury of native shippers. It was therefore
enacted that henceforth ships should not be released except by letters patent
enrolled in the chancery.⁴ In the treatment of these cases, the council
might refer the matter to any of the courts mentioned, but the usual
method, illustrated in Wythum v. Men os Kampen (p. 95) and Duval v.
Arundel (p. 96), was the primitive one of creating a commission of oyer and
terminer. Sometimes the commissions were given instructions by the
