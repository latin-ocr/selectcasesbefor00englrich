Χ] CASES BEFORE THE KING5S COUNCIL

competent persons, who were to find and bring the party wanted before the
court on a given day. Once the commissioners were told to bring their
captives “ honourably '¹ before the king and couneil; ¹ more often they were
asked to keep them safely. In an extreme instance the eouncil, on infor-
mation that certain marauders were active in Kent, Surrey and Middlesex,
appointed a commission to arrest all suspects and imprison them until
further 01-(101.2 In one ease the commissioners were threatened with a
penalty of ε191000.3 011 the failure of all other means, the most drastic
measure possible was a proclamation of outlawry. By a writ duly issued to
the sheriff public announcement was made throughout the county that
so—and-so should appear, or be made to appear, at a time and place, or
suffer the sever-est penalties. In the case of a noted outlaw, “ a certain son
of iniquity,” proelamation was ordered in all the fairs and markets of Bed-
ford and Buckingham, that whoever should arrest him or produce his body
or his head, alive or dead, should receive a reward of 3100ss In one of the
later years of Henry VI there is an instance of the successive use of writs of
the privy seal, writs under the great seal⁷ a proclamation, a eommission of
arrest and finally another proclamation under threat of forfeiturefl*

Pending trial, 01· during the intervals of a trial, parties were committed
to prison for indefinite lengths of ti1ne3 two 01· three years of durance were
nothing extraordinary. An accuser might be committed as well as a de-
fendant. The law which safeguarded judgments of life or limb was quite
indifferent to the abuses that grew up under this system. But for those
who could find security, “ mainprise‚⁷’ a system of bonds slightly different
from baily was willingly allowed. ‘¹ Mainpernors,'' as the sureties were
called, bound themselves in sums of money, sometimes as high as §5000 or
ζΕΙΟῺΟΟ, corps pur corps to have the party wherever wanted on a given day,
and in some cases made themselves responsible for his good conduct during
the interval. Mainpernors, it was once decided⁷ should not be released of
their sureties when the party came to court, but only after he had pleaded
to the issue.⁶ The amounts of money, like the sums stated in the subpoena,
were theoretical, suggesting the seriousness of the matter involved, but
were never strictly exacted. Illustrations of the use of mainprise are
afforded in the texts of Lombarcls v. Mercers (p. 45), and Release os the
Suretz'es os J olz η Davy (p. 108). The obligations were at first by no means
so perfunctory as they afterwards became, and offered a means of constraint
no doubt more effective than most prisons. But in connection with the
system of arbitrary arrest the practice was liable to abuse. Parties com-
plain that in their inability to give security, they must perforce treat with
their enemies or else go to prison.⁷
