lviii CASEs BEFORE THE K1NG>s COUNCIL

alone. This was affirmed by a decretal in 1265, which sanctioned it as an
ancient custom of the church.ll The claim was extended by Boniface VIII
to include benefices voided at the apostolic see, whether by death or any
other cause.12 It was the claim most frequently asserted by Boniface VIII,
who applied it in thirty-nine caseS‚ including that to the treasurership of
York‚ which will prcsently be argued.

3. The incumbency of a curial, that is, an officer of the papal court, was
also put forward as ground for a reservation and the provision of the next
incumbent.¹³ This claim was energetically resisted in England, to the
effect that on more than 0110 occasion promise was given that an Italian
should not succeed an Italian to any benefice. But since a curial was
likely to (lie at Rome, it was easy to provide one Italian after another to
the. same benefice indefinitely, basing the right to do so on other ground.

4. The promet-ion of a clerk often left the voided benefice to be pro-
vided to by the pope, Tliiswas based 011 the argument that in the transla-
tion of bishops, a practice of recent growth, only papal authority could
loose the tie that bound one to the church of his 00115001311011.14 It was
then the duty and privilege of the pope not to leave the divorced church
unconsoled. Likewise in regard to lesser officers, if the pope was concerned
in their promotion, there was ground for a provision to the vacated bene-
fice.1⁵

5. Also the resignation of a clerk, giving up his benefice spontaneously
into the hands of the pope, was the occasion of a provision for filling it. It
is obvious how the right of a lay patron might be thus superseded. More-
over a lay patron might in the same manner cede his right of advowson over
to the pope.¹⁶

It will readily be seen that, in spite of all theories to the contrary, the
rights of the king, the greatest of lay patrons, were sure to be affected by
the policy just outlined. For during the time of a vacancy of a bishopric
or any church of his advowson⁷ whenever in fact the temporalities of a
church were taken in hand, the profits of such benefices were enjoyed by
the king. This right, known in France as the reyale, was designated in
England as part of “the dignity of the crown and the royal inheritance.”
A feature of this prerogative which has never been fully explained, is how
the king in England, different from princes of other countries, came to
assume the collatioris pertaining to the benefices which were for the moment
in his hand. For the collation was not necessarily part of the temporalities;
