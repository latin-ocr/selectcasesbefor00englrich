ATTE WODE v. CLlFFORD 88

who were servants and tenants of the said Anselm and who had been pro-
cured by the said James and Anselm and who had come at their expense
to the said town; and then the said suppliants challenged this inquest for
the causes above given and for the reason that their challenges were found
to be true, and that the said inquest had been held in a manner favourable
to the said James and Ansehn, and that the said John Berkeley and his
companions allowed the challenges of the said suppliant and were entirely
unwilling to receive this inquest. And then on another day the said Robert
and Robert without any other of their companions held another session at
the aforesaid Gloucester upon the same matter, and there took an inquest
of the same men who had been thus procui-ed by the said James and
Anselm, (men) who at their cost came to the said town and who had previ-
ously been challenged and rejected from the inquest by themselves and
their companions for the reasons given above, this time without allowing
the said suppliants any challenge that they might make for the aforesaid
reasons 3 this matter and grievance at this last session is well known to the
said John Berkeley and Richard, who are now in this city of London.
Wherefore may it please you very wise lords and commons to have the
said John Berkeley and Richard, who are now in London, come before you
in this present parliament and to examine them in this matter and there-
upon to ordain some special remedy for the said suppliants; considering,
very gracious lords and commons, that the officers and jurors of the said
county are thus of covin and affinity of the said James and Ansehn and
have been so procured by them that the said suppliants will never have
justice for themselves in this county. Besides the said suppliants are so
far impoverished and ruined by the aforesaid horrible trespasses, oppres-
sions,'and false conspiracies that they have nothing wherewith they can
themselves pursue their right or support their children, unless your very
gracious aid be forthcoming in this present parliament, for the love of God
and in the way of charity.’' This petition was endorsed by advice of the
lords and commons in the following words: “ Let John Berkeley, knight,
and Richard Ruyall be sent for to come before the lords of parliament or
before the council of our lord the king to be examined in the matter con-
tained in this petition, and let J ames Clifford and Anselm herein described
be sent for by writ to be before the king's council on a certain day and under
certain penalty to be determined by the said counefl, and let the said council
have power by authority of parliament to do« justice to the parties by the
advice and at the discretion of the said council.” ¹⁴² By force of this en-
dorsement several writs under the great seal were addressed to the said
James Clifford and Anselm Gyse to be before the council at Westminster
