lxxvi CAsns BEFORE THE KING’S couNcu,

the petition of Werkesworth v. Pensax (p. 81) the council made a further
acknowledgement of its duty to hear the case of a poor suppliant against
a great malefactor. In all these cases the evidence is not that the council
eagerly usurped the power, but rather that it yielded to the pressure of
suitors in taking the responsibility.

LOMBARDS v. MERCERS

Almost all details of the outbreak of the London mercers against the
Lombards have vanished, save those preserved in the document here
printed. It cannot, however, be doubted that the incident was part of
that long struggle between the crown and the boroughs which had become
acute under Edward Ι and in the middle of the fourteenth century, after
various vicissitudes, was resolved, with the aid of parliament, in favour of
the crown.

In the year 1303, Edward Ι by a master-ful stroke of policy granted to
foreign merchant-s a general charter, well-known as the Carta M ercatoria.¹
Among those whose security, as the preamble recites, it was specially de-
vised to safeguard, were the merchants of Lombardy. All foreign mer-
chants were to be at liberty to enter the English dominions with all kinds
of merchandise, exempt from certain specified local exactions. They were
to be free to sell by wholesale in all cities, boroughs, and market towns,
while two classes of them, the Spicers and the Mercers, might retail spices
and the wares called mercery. This provision gave legal authority to a
practice already established,² but one which was, nevertheless‚ unpopular
in the towns, since it infringed the principle, jealously maintained where
possible, that outsiders, whether alien or native, should be excluded from
retail trade. A number of other provisions followed in favour of alien
merchants, in return for which they undertook to pay certain fixed duties
at the ports. From the first the citizens of London were restive to the new
regulations.³ Soon after the accession of Edward II, they assailed the
Carta M ercatorz'a, and in 1311 procured a royal ordinance for its revo-
cation, ‘¹ because the same was made contrary to the Great Charter and
the franchise of the City of London, and without the assent of the Baron-
age.’' ‘¹ Henceforth,’' it was ordained, “ Merchant Strangers shall come,
abide and go according to the ancient customs, and according to that which
of old they were wont to do.’⁷ ⁴³

Whether or not this ordinance was intended to exclude alien Mercers
from retail trading,⁵ it was so interpreted by the citizens of London. But
