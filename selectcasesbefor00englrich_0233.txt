UGHTRED AND o'rfflffls υ. MUSGRAVE 55

master Ralph Neville,⁹ master John Mowbray,¹0 master William Finch-
den ¹¹ and Roger F ulthorpe ¹² held seven inquests of the knights and more
substantia] squires¹³ in the county, and could not find anything against
the said Thomas Ughtred [for which] to imprison him, and whereas the
said Thomas Ughtred had a writ to the justices aforesaid to go to his
deliverance ¹⁴ as the law requires, the said sheriff delayed it of malice, that
he might not be able to be delivered.

Also the said sheriff would not deliver the said Thomas Ughtred out of
the jail of.Y0rk until the said Thomas had found as mainpernors ¹⁵ four
knights and one esquire who are under obligation and straitly bound to the

said sheriff, and each of them for the whole in five hundred pounds, to bring
the body of the said Thomas Ughtred into the jail of York at this Pentecost
next coming ¹⁶ or within that same time at one month's notice.

Also the said sheriff counselled the said Thomas to cause himself to be
indicted, and gave him to understand that if he were indicted he would
cause him to have an inquest to deliver him.

Also the said sheriff took from the said Thomas Ughtred a hundred
shillings to be partial and helpful to him in an assise of novel disseisin‚¹⁷ that

justice of the common pleas, and chief
justice of the same court on 14 April, 1371.
Foss, iii, 432.

¹² 11 Foss be right in saying (iv, 53) that
Roger Fulthorpe, who in 1377 became a
justice of the common pleas and after-
wards had a chequered career (see 1202.
Parz. v, 393), “ began his career as an ad-
vocate about 136ss he must have been
another person than this commissioner.
The Patent Rous shew that during some
years Roger Fulthorpe or Foulthorpe had
been employed on commissions of oyer
and terminer, &c., especially in Yorkshire
(1361, p. 150; 1362, pp. 206; 207, &c.).
He probably belonged to the family of the
judge‚ though he could not have been his
father, whose name was Alan. According
to Foss, the family sprang from T hirkelby,
near Thirsk, Yorkshire, but R. Surteffl,
Hist. os Durlzam (1823), iii, 126, traces it to
Fulthorpe' and Tunstall, Co. Durham,
and Hipswell, Co. York.

¹³ In the modus procedendi for the ius-
tices itfflerant, as given in Bracton (fo.
116) four knights are to be selected from
every Hundred and sworn to elect ‘¹ xii
milites vel liberos et legales homines si
milites non inveniantur,” ὅτε. For the
procedure upon these inquests 588 Pollock
ά Maitland, Hist. os Enql. Law, ii, 640, ὅτε.
“Every justice deputed to a particular
place was in Eyre, or, as we should say
⁸ on circuit! ” Stephen 1, 99.

¹⁴ This perhaps means the commission
of oyer and terminer which commissions
were sometimes special, when limited to
the trial of particular offences. Coke
divides the special commissions into five
classes, of which the third is a commis-
sion in respect “ of divers oppressions &c.,
extortions &c., by the king¹s 111111151815.υ
4th Inst. 162. By the statute of North-
ampton (2 Ed. III, c. 2, 1328), “Oyers
and Terminers shall not be granted but
before Justices of the one Bench, or the
other, or the Justices Errants, and that
for great hurt- or horrible Trespasses.'’

According to Coke (4 Insl. 164), “the
Justicae were so carefull that no innova-
tion should creep in concerning commis-
sions of oier and terminer that certain
Justices having their authority by writ,
where they ought to have had it by com-
mission, though it were of the forme and
words that the legal commission ought to
be, John Knivett, chief justice, by the
advice of all the judges resolved‚ that the
said writ was contra legem.'' Knivett did
not become Chief Justice till 29 October,
1365, very shortly prior to this case,
which perhaps records an example of the
practice which he condemned. Foss, iii,

be Sunday, 24 May, 1366.
