A precept was issued to the sheriff that whereas the king's beloved and

Goule his, the king’s uncle's, baih'ff of the manor of Inteberge,⁴ together

was known by the title of earl of Pem-
broke. His biographer in the Dict. Nat.
Bi09., from which these particulars are
taken, remarks that “the probability

before as 1264 it had been bestowed on
him by a chronicler.

⁴ Inteberge, as in Domesday3 now
InkberrOW, in Mid-Oswaldslaw Hundred,
East Worcestershire. At the time of the
Conquoet it was held by the bishops of
Hereford. During the reign of Henry 11
it passed to John Marshal, grandfather of
william of Valence's wife; though Joan
of Valenoe was found by Inquisition of
l Ed. 11 to have held the manor at the
time of his death. See Nasb, Hisc. os
Woraestershire (1782), ii, 6. ·

⁸ A claim to insanqemssies, or the right

to hang hand-having thieves, that is,
thieves caught m'th the goods upon them
within the lord's territory upon prosecu-
tion by the loser of the goods. See P. ἅτ
M., Hist. Enyl. law, i, ,ΞΜ-567. The
Inquisitions “ Quo Waranto '' for Worces-
tershire had been taken in 4 Ed. I (20
Nov. 1275-1276), Rotzdi Hundredorum
(1818), ii, 282; but it does not appear
therefrom that william de Valence en-
ioyed any such franchise in the Hundred
of Oswaldslaw. (Ibid. p. 283.)

Exchequer, 126& chancellor of England,

⁷ The return to the Inquisition Quo
Waranlo (Rot. Hund. ii, 282) is “ Dicunt
quod hundredum de Osewaldesle est in
manu Episcopi wygomensis.” The return

Valenoe.
