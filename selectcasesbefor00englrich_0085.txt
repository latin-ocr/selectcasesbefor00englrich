cer, and John Meleward, mercer, made a certain dreadful affray in the Old
Jewry‚²⁸ in the Ward of Colemanstret, in London, and of malice afore-
thought by force and arms did make assault on certain persons, namely,
Francisco Bochel and Reymund Flamy, Lombards, and did wound, beat,
and maltreat them and, against the peace of our lord the king, commit
other enormities against them. They say also that Richard Phelip, mercer,
abetted the said persons in making the affray and trespass aforesaid ; and
that the aforesaid Richard Phelip was present when the deeds aforesaid
w'ere committed3 but that the same Richard did not strike Franciseo and
Reymund aforesaid. It was inquired of the said jurors, if any other persons
had committed or perpetrated the offences and excesses aforesaid, or were
present thereat, or gave aid or abettal to the same, or gave any cause for
the same. They said that to their knowledge they did not.”

It would'thus appear that of the eight persons specified by the com-
plainants as the authors of the outrage, all but two, Forester and Meldone
or Maldon, were acquitted by the citizens. Of these Maldon, according to
the Lombards, had confessed his guilt before the council when first arrested.
Nothing is known of Forester‚ save that he is said in document D to be at
liberty upon mainprise, and that he had fled. But D gives the name of
none of his mainpernors, except Alan Everard, and is a mere note of a verbal
statement admittedly imperfect. Further, it is not confirmed by any of
the lists of mainpernors in C. Since, as Coke insists, mainprise did not
imply that the person mainperned had been in custody, these facts suggest
the inference that Forester had continued to avoid arrest. There remains
“John Meleward, mercer”. His name is not found upon the list of leading
mercers, nor was he mainperned, nor even accused by the complainants.
No mention occurs of him, save in this inquisition. It may well be that if
he were not a resident in London, the complainants may have been unable
to identify him. It is a suggestive circumstance that the only instances
I can find of persons of this name are associated with two acts of violence.
A “ John Meleward '' was indicted at the end of 1355 in conjunction with
a Bedfordshire gentleman, of the murder of John Relleye of Thurleigh, and
of the robbery of other persons in Buckinghamshire.²⁹ Three years later,
on 26 February, 1358, a pardon was issued to “ John le Melewarde ’' of
Gloucester on account of good service done in Brittany. He had been in-
dicted of the death of John de Malverne, of* which he was now declared
innocent, and had apparently become an outlawed fugitive from justice.
It is entirely consonant with the associations attached to this name that
he should have been a leader in the attack upon the Lombards and should
have become a fugitive from justice once more. Since the citizens were
bound to return some one as guilty, Maldon standing convicted on his own
