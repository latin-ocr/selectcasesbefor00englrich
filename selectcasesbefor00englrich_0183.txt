the noble man, the Lord John Earl Warenne by the dean of Bradewyce ²⁷
of the said diocese there published ordering you to appear before the
discreet man the lord 2⁸ official of the lord the archdeacon of Norfolk or his
commissary in the parish church of Saint Nicholas of Brakeden of the said
diocese on F riday next after the feast of Saint Gregory, Pope, in a cause of
matrimony and divorce in presence of the said official which by a process
with the authority of the ordinary is now in course or expected to be in
course between her, Maud petitioner of the one part, and the noble man
John Earl Warenne and for the defendent of the other part, and to do and
receive that which is of right and reason. Done on the day in the month
(and) place aforementioned in the presence of Walter of Branteston, John of
Holme, clerks, and other witnesses specially summoned and bidden to the
proceedings aforesaid. There is contained also in the same process that
after the citation aforesaid of the aforesaid countess had been made,
as is aforesaid, the said official because the said countess did not appear
before him on the day aforesaid deemed her the countess to be contuma-
cious²⁹ and again decreed that she should be summoned in certain manors
and parish churches named in the said process if she could be found there
in person or if the said countess or her proctors should not be found, a copy
of the libel aforesaid of Maud of Neyrford against the aforesaid countess
should in the presence of the official in person be placed spread out upon
the great altars of those churches and should be affixed to the doors of the
same ³⁰ and that the issue of the public citation having been published in
the manors and churches aforesaid, she should be cited to appear before
the official himself 01· before his commissary in the parish church of Saint
Nicholas of Brakeden aforesaid on the Saturday next after the Sunday on
which is sung “ misericordia Domini '¹ ³¹ to answer the aforesaid Maud in
the aforesaid cause, ὅτε. Which process in the presence of the official in
person having been produced and exhibited the question was asked³² of him
if he avows the said process, and if it is his act. He answers expressly that

REX v. GERDESTON

from Otho's constitution that construc-
tive and fictitious service had been effected
by laying citations upon the altar and then
removing them, the defendant being given
no opportunity of becoming informed of
them. His constitution implicitly dis-
penses with this formality which must
therefore have been retained as a local
custom in the diocese of Norwich. By a
decretal of Gregory IX (1227-41) (Lib.
II. Tit. xiv, c. 10) it was ordained that
‘¹ when personal service can not be
effected, the judge may decree the cita—
tion to be affixed to the door of his (the
defendant's) house, or to the Church door
during the time of divine service, and a
copy left there. This is tei-med service by

ways and means (viis et modis).’' Reichel
ii, 272.

³¹ The introit of Mass for the second
Sunday after Easter is taken from Psalm
33 (Vulgate version), 5, 6. “ Miseri-
cordia Domini plena est terra. Alleluia.
Verbo Domini coeli firmati sunt. Alleluia.¹'
Easter Day, 1315, falling on 23 March,
the second Sunday after would be 6 April
and the Saturday following 12 April. The
passage was unintelligible to and hope-
lessly bungled by the transcriber of the
Lincoln’s Inn MS. whose Latinity was
obviously imperfect.

³² Presumably by the council. On the
practice of administering interrogatories,
