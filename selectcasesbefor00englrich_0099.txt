INTRODUCTION XCV

If then, documents B and C belong to 1379—1380, to what date is A to
be assigned ? That it is earlier than B is evident. It is less caresully
draughted‚ and though B transcribes much of it, while alter-ing the order
of its clauses, the heads of gravamina in A number no more than eight as
against eleven in B. It is also to be observed that whereas the complainants
in B are anonymous‚ those in A are the people of Lowestoft who are
particularized as the promoters of the suit in 50 Edward III (1376), when
the charter was revoked. It was therefore, perhaps redraughted on the
frame of the successful petition of 1376. 11 belongs, on the face of it, to
the reign of Richard ΙΙ and to a moment at which Yarmouth is petitioning
for a fresh charter, and it contests in particular the franchises claimed in
Kirkley Road. It may be assigned, therefore, to the early part of the year
1378, in April of which year, as has been seen, John of Gaunt and the great
council provisionally restored the privileges of Yarmouth in Kirkley Road.
It must not be supposed that the successive changes of policy in the matter
of Yarmouth’s charter were due to nothing more 111311 idle caprice. The
monkish historian who was the author of Chronicon Anyliae, though his

” bitter prejudice against John of Gaunt attenuates his authority, probably

penetrates the secret of that duke’s favour to Yarmouth when he says that
he refused to h'sten to the complaints against it “quia minus favit populo
quam pecuniae.'' ³⁵ This was in 1376, when he is represented as having
long resisted the revocation of the charter, of which he secured the 10111-
porary restoration two years later. On the other hand, the commissioners
of 1381, who presented reports hostile to the charter, were careful to add
“ that the men of Great Yarmouth may sustain and bear towards our lord
the king all charges which they did sustain and bear before the granting
of the liberties and privileges aforesaid, and maintain the town, although
the same liberties and privileges should be revoked.'' ³⁶ It can readily
be understood, that in face of the protests of Yarmouth, the Treasury
hesitated at times to accept this conclusion and that in this conffict of
fiscal, local, and influential private interests no uniform policy could be
for long pursued. Behjnd the fiscal issues stood those larger ones of the
constitution. The history of the Yarmouth charter forms part of the breach
between the crown, represented by the couneil, with the king's uncle at its
head, and the house of commons, destined to develop, after a few years,
into a fatal struggle between the king himself and the two houses of parlia-
ment. In the four documents printed the conffict of legal argument is best
summarized in the replication D, “ on behalf of the commonalty of Suffolk.’'
It will be observed that Yarmouth endeavoured to obscure the real issue
by insisting that at fair time, when the bulk of the herring trade was trans-
acted, no restrictions existed. The complainants, on the other hand, replied
that what they asked for was that trade should be free in Kirkley Road at
