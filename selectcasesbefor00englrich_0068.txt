lxiv CAsEs BEFORE THE K1NG⁵s COUNCIL

must needs petition again, because he could not gain possession.⁵⁷ He
alleges that the ecclesiastical proceedings had been taken before the bishop
of Lincoln, then the king's chancellor, who, after giving judgment un-
favourably to him in the ecclesiastical court, had turned the king's writs
against him. The chancellor, he said, even granted to the provisor a writ
of supersedeas with the clause “ notwithstanding any judgrnent in the
king’s court or prohibitions,'’ an entirely illegal instrument. After further
proceedings in the chancery the petitioner said that he had been compelled
under duress to resign the church and suffer the provisor to have it. Geof-
frey was told that he might sue before the council, which would review the
record, process, and judgment. But the king’s presentee never recovered
the church of Fishlake; on the contrary, at the request of the king himself
he was induced to give it up, and was granted instead other churches with
which he was apparently satisfied.⁵8

As the reign of Edward III advances, there is evidence of more vigour
in the proceedings, both civil and crirninal, against provisors. The rolls of
the chancery abound in commissions to arrest provisors and all persons
aiding them, who treat with contempt the king's appointments, and to
bring them before the chancellor, the council, or the king's bench. The
charges are of contempt toward the authority of the crown, and of making
appeals to the Roman curia without license. It is not generally known that
the latter was a valid charge at common law and was received by the king's
courts long before the Statute of Praemunire gave it sanction. At the
same time these prosecutions often failed in their effect because the king
suspended the proceedings or sanctioned the ecclesiastical processes. On
the other hand, opposed to the material power of the state, there was not
only the great moral strength of the church3 osten there was physica]
power of resistance. For example, in 1340 the king, having presented to
the church of Foston, ordered the arrest of all persons proceeding in dero-
gation of his right.⁵⁹ But a provisor had entered the church by force,
wasting its tithes and profits and so threatening the servants of the king’s
clerk‚ that they dared not do what was incumbent upon them. Again in
1345, one of the king's commissioners reported that, after he had effected
the arrest of a papal notary, a band of men fell upon him, assaulted his
servants and rescued the prisoner.⁶⁰ In another instance a provisor, having
held possession of a church by force and anns against the king’s presentee,
was pardoned and delivered from prison on security for his good behavior,
but he only went forth with the aid of his supporters to intrude into the
church again, “ whereat the king was not without reason disturbed.’'⁶1
In other words, provisors were gaining the support of the residents and
armed men of the neighborhoods, and aggravating the disorders of the
country.
