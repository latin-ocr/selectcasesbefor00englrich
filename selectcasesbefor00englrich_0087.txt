to the king.¹ In 1399, the record of a case in this court was read in parlia-
ment,² but the usual method of the council, on receiving such a case, was to
refer it to a commission of oyer and terminer.³ The judgments then are
seldom known.

MOLYNS v. FIENNES

The petition of Gill de Molyns adds another illustration of the warning,
“ Put not your trust in princess’ In 1365, she, then some three years a
widow, petitioned the king and council against a claim put forward by one
Robert de Fiennes, described as “ of France,” because born in that country,
to the manor of Wendover, Bucks. The petition and the Patent Rolls
disclose that the estate had belonged to the Fiennes family, but was seized
by the king on the outbreak of the war with F rance, with which country,
it would appear, they had elected to cast their lot. At the time of the
seizure the widow's late husband, Sir John de Molyns‚ had stood high in
favour with the king, and for some years the grants enrolled testify to the
extent of his services or of his rapacity. At the close of his life, however,
he had been aceused of various acts of oppression, was thrown into prison,
and his lands forfeited. Although most of these were subsequently restored
to his widow, the manor of Wendover, as this case shews‚ was not, but re-
verted to the claimant Robert de Fiennes of France, who shortly after-
wards sold it to Edward III.1 Its immediate subsequent history associates
it with notable names. Before 1370, it had been granted to William of
Wykeham, bishop of Winchester‚ who resigned it in that, or the following
year, after which the king granted it to his rapacious mistress, Alice Perrers.
Upon the accession of Richard II in 1377, her lands were confiscated‚2 and
a petition of her husband, Sir William of Wyndesore, in 1381 was unsuc-
cessful in obtaining restitution of the manor.³ It was granted in 1388 to
Edward, Duke of York.⁴¹ The case was obviously beyond the jurisdiction
of the common law courts or of any tribunal but that of the king in council.

UG HTRED v. MUSGRAVE

The complaint by Sir Thomas Ughtred, and Sir John and Nicholas
Hotham, against Thomas Musgrave, sheriff of Yorkshire, in 1366, furnishes
an illustration of a popular grievance with which, throughout the thirteenth,
fourteenth, and fifteenth centuries‚ the ears of the council were constantly
assailed. Thomas Musgrave was probably the son of Sir Thomas Mus-
