who had sworn in the said inquest, suggesting that they had perjured,
he acknowledged that he spoke to some of them declaring that it weighed
heavily upon him that they had perjured, not with the intent of reproach-
ing them, and for this also he placed himself in the king's grace; and as
to his having threatened the said william Esturmy who had the king⁷s
commission to take the said Robert Yeo as had been alleged against the
said earl of Devonshire, he answered saying that he had no knowledge ⁴of
the said William having such a commission, but he did say that he would
like to break his head, and for this also he placed himself in the king's
grace. Whereupon it was adjudged by our lord the king and his said
council that the said earl of Devonshire should be committed to prison,
there to remain until he paid to our lord the king fine and ransom at the
pleasure of our said lord the king. Inunediately thereafter all the afore-
said lords, spiritual as well as temporal, prayed our lord the king to do
grace to the said earl of Devonshire, having regard for the fact that he
was of royal blood and one of his uneles,45 and that it was the first time
any such complaint had been made to our lord the king against the said
earl of Devonshire. Our lord the king at the aforesaid request extended
to the earl grace and pardon in hjs behalf on condition that he should aid
and sustain according to his power the laws of our said lord the king and
the execution thereos as well as his ministers in guarding the laws and
making execution thereos, so that if any default on his part should be
found in time to come contrary to this (understanding), our said lord the
king would take cognisance of the trespasses and the execution aforesaid,
as (though they were) trespasses and malfeasances committed and per-
petrated by him anew.⁴⁶
