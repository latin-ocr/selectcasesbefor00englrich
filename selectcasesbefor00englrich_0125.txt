CASES BEFORE THE KING’S COUNCIL

BOISTARD ν. CUMBWELL ¹

Pleas before the Council of the Lord the King for three weeks from St.
John the Baptist’s Day ² in the twenty-seventh year of the reign of King
Henry son of King John.

An assize whether Philip of Cumbwell has disseised Walter Boistard ³
of three carucates ⁴¹ of land in Chemerswell.⁵ Defendant says that Walter
never was seised nor does he show proof of seisin, because John his brother
held that holding of him, Philip, in chief as in fee, and then died without
issue. And afterwards he himself took seisin of it into his hands until the
right heir should come to render due service, and he says that Roger who
is in fealty to the king of France ⁶ is right heir and eldest son, and that he
afterwards came from the parts beyond the sea and intruded himself, but
he, defendant, did not permit him to have seisin because he did not under-
stand that he had any right, as having an elder brother. Walter says that
he asks leave to say what he desires to say, that is, that he was in peaceable
seisin during many days, and no other appears as heir. And Philip has
ejected him unjustly. And touching this, &c. the jury say that the afore-
said John died without issue, but he had a brother named Roger older than
the aforesaid Walter, that Roger is, as they believe, in Normandy and not
in fealty to the king, but they have never seen him, nor has he ever come
into these parts to put up his claim nor do they know whether he be alive
or dead, and that after J ohn’s death the defendant as chief lord took seisin
for himself, saving the right of the true heir ἀρ. Afterwards Walter,
returning from the parts beyond the sea, put himself in seisin during nine
days. Philip upon hearing this ejected him, and he asks the judgment of
the court to decide if such seisin by Walter and ejection by Philip were
disseisin. Afterwards because he gives evidence that Walter has an elder
brother in Normandy and has land there and has done homage to the
bishop of Bayeux,⁸ and the bishop himself to the king of France,⁹ by
counsel of the court the land is to be held in the king’s hand until the king
otherwise (determine). And the court caused Philip to be given fifteen
marks.¹⁰ And day was given him for hearing his judgment before the

holder, except tenant in srankalmoign, the doing of fealty and of homage; for
