availed themselves of ample opportunities
to enrich themselves appears from a com-
plaint of the Commons in 1399 (Rot. Parl.
iii, 439 b). See Select cases in the Star
Chamber (1477-1509), p. xxvii, n. l.

⁵² Henry of Brysele, Briseleye, Brisele,
Brusele, or Brysely was, like John Wasen-
ham, a man of business and, apparently,
not a Mercer. We first meet with him as
‘¹ master of the moneys,” in modern par-
lance, master of the mint, in 1353 (Pat.
Rolls, 26 February, 1354, pp. 7, 12). On
31 May, 1355 he was promoted to the
lucrative office of ‘⁴ changer and assayer of
the king’s moneys in his charges in the
Tower of London and elsewhere’' (ib. p.
238), but was displaeed by Hugh de Wych-
yngham on 7 November, 1356 (ib. p. 467).
He was, however, appointed by the king¹s
council on 16 July, 1358, one of two com-
missioners empowered “ to take in the City
of London and the suburbs carpenters,
masona, and other workmen for the repairs
of the housoe ordained for the works of the
king's money in the Tower of London, and
put them to the work to stay therein at
the king's wages so long as shall be neces⁴
sary, taking and imprisoning any found

contrariant or rebellious.’' (Pac. Rolls, p.
87.) He received a similar commission on
5 June, 1360, ‘¹ to select miners and other
workmen '⁵ to work in the king’s mines in
Devonshire, he and his fellow-commis-
sioner being styled “ masters of the king’s
mines in the county of Devon'’ (ib. p. 371).
As the two were already lessees of all the
king’s mines of gold and silver in that
county (8 Feb. 1360, ib. p. 336), it is evi-
dent that the commission was to assist
them in compelling miners to work for
them. That he was also engaged in some
business associating him with mercers
appears from a recognizance by which he,
with three mercers, John de Wesenham
and three others, was bound in 5:2000 to
the late keeper of the king’s Wardrobe (16
February, 1359, close Roas, p. 611).

It would appear, therefore, that onJy
Lacer and Alan Everard, among the seven
mainpernors of Wroxham, belonged to the
Company.

⁶⁵ In the Close Roll for August, 1354, p.
89, William atte Welde is given as one of
the two sheriffs. The name appears in
