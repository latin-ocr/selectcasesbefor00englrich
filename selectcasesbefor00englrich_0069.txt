INTRODUCTION lxv

Sooner or later such a problem at law was sure to pass from petitions
and suits to acts of legislation. In 1340 a concession was made to ecclesi-
astical interests, when in regard to “ exception of plenarty‚’' brought for-
ward in Bedewynde's case, it was agreed that the king would make no
6011311011 or presentment, whether to benefices in his own right or in the
right of another, after three years from the time of νοῇ-131166.62 Ι1 was the
expressed desire of the clergy to restrict the time still further to the six
months set by canonical law. Although the king was inclined to yield his
claim in any given case, after the benefice had been held for a year or more,
the statutory restriction was resented 35 prejudicial to the king and his
heirs. It was therefore repealed, under the promise that the king's right
in such cases should be well exa1nined.⁶³ The stronger current of legislative
acts ran toward the limitation of papal provisions. In 1343 the king
frankly warned the pope that the nobles and commons assembled in parlia-
ment would‘no longer endure the injuries caused by the immense number
of provisors invading the kingdom.⁶⁴ In 1344 the commons asked for
3 statute to this effect. Unwilling as yet to concede a statute, the king
went so far as to issue a proclamation, which follows in the main the lines
already laid down by the courts and traces in advance some of the terms
of the later statute.⁶⁵ Reciting the preamble of the Statute of Carlisle
in regard to the foundation of churches‚ it adds the significant clause:
“ and of these (ecclesiastical) possessione the king and magnates had
custody during voidance.'' Furthermore the proclamation declared the
bringing in of bulls‚ letters, processeS‚ 616, prejudicial to the king and
the people to be a criminal offense punishable by forfeiture. Thus the
way was prepared for the long desired Statute of Provisors in 1351,
which extended the terms of the foregoing proclamation. Repeating
the preamble of the Statute of Carlisle, it declared that this holdeth
always and has never been repealed. As to collation of benefices its
main stress was laid upon the claims that had been 561 forth many years
before in Bedewynde's case, that in spite of reservations or provisions by
the pope, 31 1116 111116 of voidance‚ the king as well as other lords shall en-
ioy 1116 collations of benefices which be of their advowry. Against the in-
terference of provisors crimina] processes were strengthened, to the effect
that all persons concerned in the illegal practices were to be attached and
held until further notice, if convicted they were to be imprisoned without
bail, and in extreme cases outlawed. The eloser related Statute of Prae-
munire in 1353 added the statement that all subjects of the king suing in
a foreign court matters cognizable vin the king’s court, or questioning else-
where the judgments of the king's court, shall be brought before the king
and council, or in his chancery, or before his justices to answer. How ex-
tensively the council was concerned with these questions we have seen from
the foregoing cases.
