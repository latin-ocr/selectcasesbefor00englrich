BOISTARD v. CUMBWELL

The first case that we are able to present was considered to require the
attention of the council on account of the international question involved.
It was an action of novel disseisin, the defendant maintaining that the
plaintiff was not the heir, but that the heir was the plaintiff’s elder brother.
That brother, however, lived in Normandy, and had done homage to the
bishop of Bayeux, who was a homager of the king of France, with whom,
and therefore with his feudatories, Henry was at war. If the rightful heir
were thereby incapacitated from inheriting, was the ejection of the next
heir by the defendant, the superior lord, a disseisin ? In whom, in short,
in this state of facts, did the seisin reside? It is unfortunate that owing
‘to the absence of the “ chief justiciar,'' the archbishop of York, no record
remains of the final judginent of the council. Nevertheless, the law on
the subject of the tenure of land by persons abroad was sufficiently es-
tablished, and in the year 1244 was put in execution on a large scale.¹

The heir by right of birth to three carucates of Berkshire land, Roger
Boistard, though resident in Normandy, does not appear to have been an
alien born. But he was involved in a mesh of conflicting feudal obligations
not uncommon in those times. He is described as being in sealty to the
king of France and as having done homage to the bishop of Bayeux. He
would do sealty as a freeholder, and probably to a royal official ;2 but
homage imported a more intimate relation and was a ceremony which
could only be performed between the lord and the tenant in person.
