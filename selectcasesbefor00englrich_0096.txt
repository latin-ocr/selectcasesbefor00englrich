xcii CASEs BEFORE THE KING’s COUNCIL

with the public welfare as opposed to arbitrary privilege.²¹ The commis-
sion did not get to work until the rising was at an end. On 23 September,
it held an inquisition at Lowestoft and another on 26 September at Nor-
wich. The resolutions passed by the juries were that the privileges claimed
by Yarmouth were opposed to common law, as well as to the statute passed
by the parliament of Gloucester in favour of freedom of trade3 that the
wind frequently made it difficult for ships lying in Kirkley Road to beat
up to Yarmouth, so that they were compelled to make jettison of their
cargos of herring; that the townsmen of Yarmouth, on the authority of
their charter, prevented the purchase and sale of victuals and merchandise
by the general public at any time of the year in Kirkley Road; that ships
bringing in their cargos of herrings to Yarmouth occupied twice as much
time as if they discharged in Kirkley Road, and that Yarrnouth could
afford to pay its dues to the crown even without its privileges.²2 Parlia-
ment, which met on 16 September, 1381, was besieged by “ the supplication
of the commons of Norfolk, Suffolk, and all England '’ against the pro-
visions of the charter of 1378. On the last day of its sitting, 25 February,
1382, the king and council revoked the charter so far as the franchise was
concerned which prohibited any ship to discharge within seven leagues
elsewhere than at Yarmouth and Kirkley Road or any fair or sale of
merchandise to be held within the same distance during the fishing season.²³
The parliament which followed, in May, 1382, shewed the same strong
feeling in favour of unrestricted commerce. Foreign merchants were en-
couraged to trade.2’⁴1 Yarmouth was specially reprobated as one of those
seaports in which the citizen “ hosts,'’ or supervisors of the transactions of
strangers, habitually abused their position and were warned “ to utterly
cease and be amoved from their noyaunce and wicked deeds and fore-
stallings.” No iinpediment was to be placed either in the way of foreigners
or of denizens to hinder their traffic in victuals or fish, “ under the colour
of any custom, ordinance, privilege, or charter before made or had to the
contrary, which by tenour of these presents be utterly repealed.'' ²⁵ Within
two years and a half Yarmouth was again bewailing the downfall of its
prosperity and invoking the aid of the king. A petition of February, 1385,
set forth that the deprivation of its franehises had been followed by the
depopulation of the town, “ leaving it desolate and insufficient to defend
itself against the king's enemies.'’ ²⁶ In the following year (1386), a petition,
to which it secured the support of some members of the house of conunons‚²⁷
drew a graphio picture of its calainities. Its see-farm rent and its tenth,
added to its expenditure on its defences, involved it in heavier liabilities
than any borough in the six neighbouring counties. The town was now so
