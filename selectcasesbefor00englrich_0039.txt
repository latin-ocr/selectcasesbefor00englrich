wrought the necromancy.¹ In the same year the Witch of Eye, who was
involved in the same affair, was tried by a special commission, before whom
the clerk of the council read the art-icles of examination‚ some of which the
defendant denied and others admitted.² The special significance of these
cases will be seen in connexion with the interrogatory examinations to be
treated in the following section.

6. PROCEDURE

,gt was in methods of procedure more than in substantive jurisdiction ζ
that the council and the chancery were distinguished from the courts of
common law. It is generally understood that the original influence in this
direction came from the civil law through the practices of the ecclesiastical
courts, though the extent of Romanist influence has been a matter of dis-
pute. The very names “ petition,’' “ exception‚'' ‘¹ examination,’' “ inter-
rogation,” “ replication,” “ confession‚” ‘¹ decree ” are taken from the
Roman vocabulary3 at the same time it is significant that other terms of
ecclesiastical law like “ citation,⁷' “ libel,⁷’ “ caution‚'' ‘¹ interdict,’y “ de-
nunciation,⁷’ “ deposition,” “ position,” have been avoided in secular
practice. Moreover the question of Roman origins is complicated by the
fact that some of the methods of the equitable courts came by way of the
common law. There was certainly no slavish imitation of the clerical
system, but an adoption and adaptation of certain features that were found
useful. A better analysis of the factors involved may be expected when a
further publication of ecclesiastical cases shall have been made.

Q has been said before, the first step to bring a suit or complaint before
the council was a petition; a bill as it was commonly called in litigation.
Compared with a writ of common law, a bill was the distinguishing feature
of all equitable procedure, which existed to a degree in the exchequer and
before the justices in eyre, as well as in the council, the chancery, and the
admiralty. The original idea, and possibly the word,³ may have come from
the petition or supplicatory libel of the clerical courts, but there is no fur-
ther likeness in form or character. The earliest of our secular petitions in
fact are hardly different from letters and were probably composed by letter-
writers. They came to be much more elaborate, but always retained a
greater lack of formality than was permitted to other legal documents.
Customarily the petition consisted of the address, the grievanee, and the
prayer. The address was to the king, the king and council, the king or lords
in parliament, the council, or the chancellor, with other variations. There
was no requirement that the petitioner should name the court for his suit;
this might be determined later. There were in time many expressions to
dignify the address, such as “ good‚’' “ wise,'’ ‘¹ gracious‚'' “ honourable,’'
