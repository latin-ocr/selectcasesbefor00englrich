This schedule was written in the council according to information given
by certain mercers of London then and there present, for the reason that the
roll of the suretyships aforesaid was not there at hand.

PARSON OF' LANGAR v. CONYNGSBY

PARSON OF LANGAR v. CONYNGSBY¹

To our lord the king and his good council sheweth Thomas parson of
Langar ² in the county of Nottingham that whereas the portmanteau of the
said Thomas was stolen before Chartres³ in France and the servant of the
said Thomas sued a certain man, servant of William Conyngsby‚⁵ in the
marshalsea before the constable and marshal,⁴ where they were adjudged to
combat‚⁵ and because the said Thomas was afraid of (incurring) irregu-
larity⁷ he withdrew his said servant from his suit; and then came the
said Sir William into the said marshalsea and entered suit by bill against
the said Thomas, alleging in his plaint that between the said Thomas and
his servant by abetting of the said Thomas an understanding of the two
had been reached, (whereby) the servant of the said Thomas brought suit
against the servant of the said Sir William damaging the said Sir William
(to the extent) of a hundred marks, and these damages were awarded him
in the absence of the said Thomas contrary to law.⁸ And because of the
aforesaid error the king took the case into his hand, giving a day for the
parties to be before his council in England there to be judged because
the marshalsea has no cognisance of such a plea. And since the return of
our lord the king to England there came the said Sir William and many
others in his company at daybreak to the house of the said Thomas parson
of Langar, dragging him out of his bed-and taking him to the house of Lord
Tiptoft, and then into Sherwood ⁹ and there forced him to make fine in 100
marks paying 04:10 down and giving bond for 400 marks to secure the pay-
ment of the 100 marks agreed upon between them ; thence they took him
to Lenton‚¹⁰ and before they permitted him to leave their company made
him swear on the sacred body of God to keep the aforesaid covenant. And

60 he was in the company of the earl of
Warwick. (Ibid. 34 Ed. III, 386.) In 1360
in consideration for his good service on this
expedition he was pardoned for the death
of Thomas Clynton (ibid.)⁴

⁸ In the court of chivalry suits were
begun by bill and trial was by witnesses,
or failing these, as in the present case, by
wager of battle. Harcourt, 366.

⁷ A clerk was forbidden by the law of
the church to go before a lay court and
seek a judgment of blood (Pollock dc
Maitland, Hisl. Enq. Lau> [1898], i, 456).
The church dealt severely with blood-
guiltiness among the ἀει-ῃ. O. J. Reichel,
Manual os Carum Law (1896), i, 239.

⁸ “ One thing our law would not do. It

would exhaust its terrors in the endeavour
to make the defendant appear, but it
would not give iudgment against him until
he had appeared7 and, is he was obstinate
enough to endure imprisonment or out·
lawry‚ he could deprive the plaintiff of his
remedy.'’ (Pollock ἀ Maitland, ii, 594.)
Whether the court of ehivalry was bound
by this law was of course the question.
As to the appeal on error see Introd.

⁹ Sherwood Forest, in early timae ex-
tending over a fflth of the county of Not-
tingham‚ more wooded than most foroets
and the resort of many criminal bands.
