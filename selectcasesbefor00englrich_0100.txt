XCVl CASES BEFORE THE KING’S COUNCIL

fair there to the commercial injury 01 that 01 Υο1111011111. Τ110 “ conflict 01
laws,'' whether statutory or prerogatival, carried the disputants back to
the middle 01 Edward III's reign. By a general Act 01 1354‚³⁷ no ship
could bc compelled to enter or remain in any port, and incoming ships were
to be free to sell their merchandise on shipboard, without first bringing it
to land. Of this concession advantage was taken by the townsmen 01
Yarmouth, who forestalled the fish at sea and combined to sell to the
general consumer at enhanced prices-³8 When, therefore, the Suffolk
petitioners cited the statute of 1354, prohibiting the exercise 01 compulsion
upon incoming ships, Yarmouth retorted that the Ordinance 01 Herring
01 1357, by forbidding sales at sea, had practically repealed the earlier act.
The petitioners replied that neither statute nor charter could have con-
templated such consequences as ensued, viz., that ships laden with perish-
able cargos, like fish, should suffer loss by being compelled to go from
Kirkley Road, where they could have sold them, to Yarmouth at seven
leagues' distance, whereby the commonalty suffered loss 101 1110 private

By the Ordinance of Herring 01 1357, 1110 Βο10115 01 the Cinque Ports,
in confirmation of previous rights, were constituted joint governors with
the bailiffs of Yarmouth 01 1110 yearly fair. A charter, urged the peti-
tioners, which annulled an agreement approved by the king, ought at
least not to have been granted without affording all parties an opportunity
to state their objections. The point touches form rather than substance.
The ordinance 01 1357 distinctly lays down that only “ the ships called the
Pykers '’ should be at liberty during the fair to buy fish at Kirkley Road,
and that the rest of the fishermen should not sell their herring otherwise
within seven miles 01 Yarmouth, and with these provisions the charter does
not appear to confiict. Yarmouth answers with the complaint that in
1376 115 01101101 was “ revoked without reply,'' to which Lowestoft retorts
that it was “ repealed in full parliament.'' Whatever the exact signifi-
cance to be attached to these words, it is at any rate apparent that it was
repealed as a consequence of the petitions addressed to the erown during

In support of its privileges Yarmouth appcaled to the ethical code which
it represented itself as righteously endeavouring to enforce. For fishennen
to sell their fish at Kirkley Road, or elsewhere in the neighbouring sea, was

petitioners were too discreet to attempt to justify “ forestalling.⁷’ If such
there were, they replied, it could be punished. The real delinquents were
