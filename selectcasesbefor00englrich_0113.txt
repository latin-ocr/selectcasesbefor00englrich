writing the same letters, so as to make it appear that an alteration had been
made. They would thus not invalidate the record, but hoped to cast
discredit on the opposing attorney.

Danvers had as yet no influence at court, that he was permitted to come
without any petition and lay his grievance before a full meeting of the
council. The rasure of a record indeed was a matter of public interest
which the council desired to hear. After the opening statement of Danvers,
and an exhibition of transcripts of the record, two clerks of the chancery
were examined, who pointed to William Broket, a clerk of the exchequer as
the probable culprit. Complete proof of his guilt was then presented by
Danvers who had skillfully drawn Broket into an incriminating corre-
spondence. The letters were now produced in court. Faced with the
evidence, Broket broke down and confessed that at the instigation of his
client John Lydyard he had rased the record just as his accuser had said.

For this cause Broket was forthwith removed from his place in the
exchequer and disqualified from ever serving in any of the king’s courts.
In declaring Danvers innocent the council agreed that for his complete
exonoration a record of the case should be enrolled in the chancery. It
is not unlikely that the skill displayed at this time by the young lawyer was
a recommendation for his fflibsequent employment in the king's service.

NEVILLE v. NEVILLE

The memorandum entitled Neville v. N eville is a fragment pertaining to
the long feud that was arising between two branches of the house of Neville.
This had its origin in the two successive marriages contracted by Ralph
Neville‚ first earl of Westmoreland (d. 1425),1 the first marriage having
been with Margaret Stafford, and the second, a more pretentious alliance,
with Joan Beaufort of royal blood. The father laboured indefatigably to
found the fortunes of the children of his second family, in preference to the
first, by a series of great matches and by a diversion of a good half of the
Neville patrirnony.² So that the larger share of the landed estates and
political influenee of the Nevilles ultimately fell to the descendants of Joan,
herein mentioned as the countess of Westnioreland. There was plenty of
ground for contentiori between the two sides, but the immediate object of
dispute was the late earl’s will disposing of his personal property.³ The
wiss was brought before the exchequer‚ but its-execution was in suspense by

any time, but that no process shall be
annulled or discontinued by such a chal-
lenge. The interpretation of this act gave
rise to such diversity of opinion that it was
reaffirmed in Stat. 9 Hen. V, i, c. 4 and
4 Hen. VI, c. 3, with the addition that the
justices before whom a. plea was pending
might amend a record either before or
after judgment. Stat. 8 Hen. VI, c. 12

lays down that no Judgment, once given,
shall be reversed on the ground of an error
in any record.
