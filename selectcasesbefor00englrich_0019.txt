earlier age, found the rolls abounding in cases that were treated in whole or
part by the council from the thirteenth century onward. A few of these
were set forth in the history of The Kiny's Councz‘l in the M iddle A yes (1913),
especially in Append'm III, under the title Cases and Leqal Proceedz'nqs.
Had the writer then foreseen the present work, he would probably have
held this part in reserve, in order that the cases might be kept together and
treated more expansively in the volume now presented. As it is, two cases
are now reproduced, translated and further annotated, one because of the
discovery of a better text, the other because of its special interest.

Besides the works already mentioned there are various publications in
which cases before the council are incidentally to be found, printed but not
edited. The Placitorum Abbrem'atio (Rec. Com. 1811), faulty as its tran-
scriptions are, continues to be the most extensive compilation that we have
of extracts from the earliest court rolls, in which cases before the curia
regis, the king's bench, t-he king's council, &o are mingled. The Rotuli
Parliamentorum (Rec. Com. 1767—77), especially in the earlier volumes,
before distinctions between parliamentary and conciliar proceedings were
drawn, contain cases before the council as well as pleas best classified as
belonging to the king's bench. Throughout the Middle Ages in fact cases
were likely to be heard at alternate stages in parliament and before the
council. The record may be in whole or part upon the Parliament Roll.
In the case of Alte Wode v. Clifford (infra, p. 86) the Parliament Roll is sup-
plemented by the record of the council. Since the council had no roll of its
own, whenever a permanent record of the case was desired, a transcription
or “ exemplification,'’ as it was called, might be ordered upon one of the
rolls of the chancery. The dorse of the Close Roll was most likely to be
used for entries of this character, less often the Patent Roll. The compilers
of the Calendars of Close Rolls and Patent Rolls have generally reproduced
these portions of the rolls at length, usually translated, sometimes in the
original language. Two or three cases of interest may be looked for in the
forthcoming Calendar os Close Rolls of the reign of Richard II. Since these
cases are widely separated and not easily brought together, it has been
thought that a table of such cases, as presented in the Append'u( to this
volume, might prove useful.

Among the manuscript collections in the Public Record Office, none has
been more constantly resorted to for the purposes of this work than the
files of Ancient Petitions, already mentioned. Sometimes the petition and
its endorsement is the only record of a case; often it is supplementary to the
record. At any stage of a litigation in fact a petition or counter-petition
may be looked for. The search is not difficult with the aid of an alphabetical
index (Isists ‹1- I ndentes, P. R. O. vol. i). Would that the same were true of
petitions in chanceryl for the chancery was the constant resort of suitors
who failed with parliament and the council. But the Chanoery Proceedz'nys,
containing some 300‚000 petitionS, are too voluminous for any analysis or
