cranNs OF LONDON v. THE BISHOP OF BATH 15

To our lord the king prays Gerard Mauhan⁴¹³ that he has for seven years
remained in strict confinement in the Tower of London by command of the
treasurer and barons of the exchequer, because of the error and ignorance

⁴ and contrivance of his enemies, to the injury and damage of the king,

because of the accounts and assays of money beyond what he was bound,
contrary to the king’s ordinance of money,⁴¹⁴ and contrary to usage of the
mint ; wherefore he prays to our lord the king that for his profit and for
(the sake of) justice he may be willing to assign Sir Itier Dengolesme ⁴¹⁵
and Master William of Wymondham 4⁶ warden of the mint to examine the
business by (aid of) lawful men, who are acquainted with monetary affairs,
saving his enemies, and justly to terminate the matter. In the meanwhile
he prays the king, if it pleases him, that he (the petitioner) may be delivered
under bonds to be ready from day 10 day to respond and answer, so far as
he ought to answer, the king or any man who may have anything to say
against him. For God’s sake take pity upon him who has remained in
prison seven years without deserving it.

William Savage⁴⁷ armourer of London complains that the bishop of Bath
wrongfully detains from him 110s., 'which he was to have paid 011 St.
Stephen's day ⁴¹⁸ during the week of last Christ-mas for armour which the
aforesaid bishop took from him by force 10 his own use without the consent
of the aforesaid William, wherefore he prays for remedy.

⁴⁹ Moreover the same Matthew of the Exchequer ⁵⁰ prays that auditors
may be assigned to him, knights who are not justices,⁵¹ 10 hear and determine
the grievances whereof he complains against the bishop of Bath, for he
shows that whereas he was brought to Westminster by the gaoler of the
Fleet who had him in guard, and moreover was guaranteed by the said
gaoler there,⁵² the said bishop had a false judgment rendered against him
that he had broken the prison, and had him committed to the Tower of
London there to be kept for two years. Then came the said bishop to the
Tower and had him stripped to his shirt, without 511085 01 girdle and with-
out bed, had him put ‘¹ in Polard” ⁵³ chained “ in J ordan’' ⁵³ in two pairs of
fetters; and then he was put in the black cellar on the bare ground, where
he remained for two years without any kind of fire or light, nor had he
anything to drink except from the well of the Tower where the rats drown

filled. According to the next entry it was
a petition of Matthew of the Exchequer.

⁶⁰ Named in 1290 10 110Ιά 1118 office of
usher of the exchequer jointly with Adam
of Stratton (Red Book os Exch. iii, p.
cccxxxiii). In the same year he was in-
volved in a quar-rel which was heard
before the count-‚il in ρει-1181118111. Judg-
ment was not given, but Matthew was
proved to have been guilty of deception.
1302. Parl. i, 22.

⁵¹ This passage is significant of the
distrust that was felt of the king’s justices
since the state trials of 1290.

⁶² Τ118 laxness of the keepers of the
Fleet in letting their prisonem go at large,
either with or without bail, was notorious.
A statute, 1 Rich. II, c. 12, forbids the war-
den to let at large prisoners in execution.

⁵³ Tbese are unexplained phrases. Tbey
may be nicknamae for those parts of the
pnson.
