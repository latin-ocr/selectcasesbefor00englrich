³⁷ John de Bures and John de Byernes
(in Stow, Barnes) are mentioned as sheriffs
of London in 1358-59‚ when they paid a
sum to the receipt of the Exchequer on
behalf of the commonalty of Middlesex in
substitution for ten mounted archers which
the county had been ordered to raise for
foreign service (Pat. Rolls, 10 August,
1359, p. 252). John Bures was perhaps
the John Eum, draper‚ who in 1375 was a
legatee of Thomas de. St. Alban (Cal. os
Court os Hustinq‚ ii, 172). The will of John
Biernes, alderman, dated July, 1375, was
proved in the same year. He constituted
by it the Groeers, Drapers and Mercers
Companies and the City Chamberlain trus-
tees of a fund for the loan of money not
exceeding „210 ‘¹ to such as are in need,
security being taken for the same'y (ibid.
p. 150). His name appears in the A list of
leading mercers as Bernes.

³⁸ “ Mainpernors, Manucaptores, are
those Persons to whom a Person is de-
livered out of Custody or Prison, and they
become security sor him, either for appear·
auce or satisfaction: they are called
Manucaptores, because they do it as it

were manu capere et ducere captivum e
custodia vel prisona.'' J. Cowel, Inter-
preler. Coke defines differently, being at
pains to distinguish mainprise from bail.
⁴¹ Every bail is a mainprise (for those that
are bail take the person bailed into their
hands and eustody) but every mainprise is
not a bail, becase no man is bailed but he
that is arrested, or in prison, for he that is
not in custody or prison cannot be de·
livered out. . . . But a man may be
mainperned which never was in prison, and
therefore mainprise is more large than
bailfl Inst. 179. It is clear, however,
from these papers that the word mainprise
was currently used as equivalent to bail,
as may be seen from the French note on
the case of Henry and William Cove,
while the defendants Wodeford, Everard,
VVroxham and Forester had apparently
never been in custody‚ but are described
also as on mainprise. See Introd. p. xl,
supra.
