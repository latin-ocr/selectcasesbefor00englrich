LOWESTOFT υ. YARMOUTH 62

reason that the said pedlars and carters will not be able to come to the said
town of Yarmouth because they must make two passages towards the said
town of Yarmouth at great risks and costs.¹l

Also may it please the king and lords that no such charter be granted
to the said Bailiffs and Burgesses of Yarmouth contrary to the said statute
and to the damage and decay of all the commons by the causes afore-
nanied; as a work of charity.¹²

B PETITION or Lownsrorr

1379 These are certain causes for which the charter granted by the king to
the bailiffs and burgesses of Yarmouth ought to be repealed.¹³

Because in time of the king Edward, grandfather of our lord the king
that now is, it was ordained in parliament by statute that every liege of
the realm should be able to buy and sell all merchandises and victuals with-
out impeachment within cities, boroughs, seaports‚ and elsewhere, and if
charters of franchises or usages should have been granted by patent to the
contrary they should be held for null. And in case that the said bailiffs
and burgesses [have] a charter that none buy around their town for seven
leagues it is not reasonable, the said statute being in force.¹4

Also whereas in the time of the same grandfather in full parliament the
twenty-eighth year of his reign it was ordained by statute for profit of the
king and commons of the reahn that no manner of ships fraught towards
England or elsewhere be compelled to come to any port of England nor to
remain against the will of the masters [and] mariners of such ships, or of
the merchants whose the goods be, the which statute was never repealed,¹⁵
and in case that the bailiffs and burgesses have a charter that all manner
of ships charged with merchandises and herring and that enter into Kirkley
Road which is in the county of Suffolk and six leagues from the said town
of Yarmouth which is in the county of Norfolk that want to sell their herring
there that they must come to the said town of Yarmouth [it] is unreasonable
and contrary of the said statute being the said statute in force.
