MOLYNs v. FrnNNEs 52

and approved. And the aforesaid Robert de Fiennes says that all persons
of either of the realms of England and France who have been by occasion of
the wars aforesaid disinherited of their lands and hereditaments ought by
the peace aforesaid to be wholly restored in the same rights and possessions
as they had before the beginning of the wars aforesaid,28 and accordingly
that restitution extends to the aliens-born of either kingdom, the which
peace was confirmed and sworn by the king, prelates and magnates and
commonalty of the kingdom of England in full parliament, and he says that
the manor aforesaid by occasion of the wars aforesaid and arising out of no
other cause fell into the hand of the king and that the aforesaid Robert de
Fiennes is heir of the aforementioned Robert son of Williain and that by the
adhesion of this Robert de Fiennes to the party opposed to the lord the king
the said manor was taken into the king's hand. And since because by the
peace aforesaid it has been so agreed by the kings of either realm for the
common advantage of the realms aforesaid and of the public weal, the claim
ought to be tried and determined, not by the common law of England, but
according to the force and intent of the peace aforesaid, especially since the
aforesaid Gill shews no legal title in her own person to exclude the aforesaid
Robert de Fiennes of France from his action and it is in the will of the lord
the king to admit of his favour aliens—born to hold their hereditaments
in the reahn of England as in times past has been customary to be done, and
he prays that the said manor be taken into the king's hand and restored to
the aforementioned Robert de Fiennes of F rance as cousin and heir of the
aforesaid Robert son of William according to the form of the peace afore-
said. And because the aforesaid matter having been tried before the lord
the king and the magnates and others of his council and examined by the
king himself it was put on record that the aforesaid Robert de Fiennes of
F rance is cousin and heir of the aforesaid Robert son of William, through
whose forfeiture the manor aforesaid by occasion of the wars aforesaid and
not from any other cause fell into the hands of the king himself, and by the
said king and all the magnates and others of the council of the king in person
sitting as his assessors it was agreed that the treaty of peace aforesaid
should be observed and holden in all its articles and committed to execution,
the allegations aforesaid notwithstanding; that though it be done in this
special case for restoration of the peace, to be observed according to the
force, effect and intention of the same peace, yet there is no derogation of
the common law in other cases. Whereby it⁴ was adjudged that the manor
aforesaid be seized into the king's hand and restored to the aforementioned
Robert de F iennes of France as cousin and heir of the aforesaid Robert son
of William according to the form of the peace aforesaid, and a precept was
issued to the sheriff of Bucks for the seizure of the manor with its appurte-
nances forthwith into the king's hands and for its custody till he should have
another cormnand from the king in that behalf. This record and process
together with the petition aforesaid having been seen and examined, and
