UGHTRED AND OTHERS v. MUSGRAVE 59

proffered him a hundred shillings to be a favourable [friend and official in]
the said assize, the which sum he then refused, and the said Master William
suggested to him that in case of [his being unwilling] to receive [the said]
sum, that the said master Thomas Ughtred would be exceedingly disheart-
ened by his not being willing to act reasonably as pertains to his office ; and
he answered him that he would duly execute his office; and afterwards the
parties were at an accord by the mediation of the Iords Percy, Neville,
Clifford ’Β and de Maulay ³⁰ and master Richard Scrope ³¹ that the said
assize should be ended by consent, and it then ended by consent, and so the
said master William gave him that sum without that he took it in any other
manner or was [opposed to him] in that assize.

And thereupon the question was asked of the aforementioned Thomas
Musgrave, if he desires to charge any particular act against the aforesaid
Thomas Ughtred, John Hotham. knight, junior, and Nicholas Hotham, or if
he himself held inquest of the premises in due manner as is supposed, or if
they were themselves indicted before him, or if he found aught upon them
whence a suspicion of crime might be entertained. The sheriff abides by
his answer above said. And thereupon Henry Lord Percy and Ralph
Neville there present in the council, who had been assigned by commission
of the lord the king to inquire as to the above and other matters, were
examined, and they say that they have diligently held inquest in that be-
half . . . of diverse places in which it was right and needful and have
caused the men who have been plundered . . . inquests touching the
truth. Also that they have found nothing against the aforesaid Thomas
Ughtred, [John and NJicholas Hotham touching the felonies aforesaid, nor
have they heard that the aforesaid Thomas, John and Nicholas [have been
indicted of those felonies] . . . of other felonies which. ‚they had been

seated‘ 111 the East Riding and North Lin-
colnshire.’ The liv es of both father and

tei-est in the mauors, &a conveyed to him
by Henry Lord de Percy, Roger de Clis-

ford, Sir John de Hothum and others in
trust for his mother Margaret for life, &c.
He succeeded his father at the age of 24 in
1355. He was himself a complainant in
1362 of violence done in his park of Boyn-
ton of the Walde, Co. York (Pat. Rolls, 36
Ed. III, p. 206), and again at other places
in Yorkshire in 1366 (Pal. 40 Ed. 111, p.
280). On the latter of these occasions the
commission of oyer and terminer included
John Moubray, William Fyncheden,
Simon Hoelarton aud Roger Fulthorp,
with four others (ib.). In 1365 118 was a
commissioner of array for the East Riding
(ib. p. 365). Μ. 3 here reads Moubray;

¹¹ Sir Richard Scrope, or le Scrope;
third son of Sir Henry le Scrope, chief jus-
tice of the king¹s bench, whose father

son are given in the cht. Nm! Bioy.
Richard was knighted at the battle of
Nevill's Cro& in 134& sat for Yorkshire
in 1364 and in 1378 became chancellor.
The Patent R'olls shew that he was fre-
quent-ly employed as a commissioner of
oyer and terminer in Yorkshire; as in
1364 (38 Ed. III, pp. 69, 73; 1365, 39 Ed.
ΙΙΙ, pp. 146, 151). His seat appears to have
been at Briggenale, York, where he com-
plained. of poaching in his parl: (8 July,
1365, Pat. Rolls, 39 Ed. 111, p. 200). It is
to be noted that though he is in this docu-
ment styled ‘¹ monsieur,'' yet as “ Richard
scrope, Knight,'¹ he was on 22 May, 1365
nominated a commissioner of oyer and
terminer in a case of violence at Colthorp
and Bekerton, York (Par. Rolls, 39 Ed.
III, p. 147). He died in 1403.
