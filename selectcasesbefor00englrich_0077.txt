record of the hearing at one stage before the council. Evidently a suit was
first begun on complaint of the injured Genoese merchants, but because of
its public interest the suit had been dropped in favour of a prosecution in
the name of the king. At this point our record begins. According to a
now established procedure, the hearing was in the chancery “ according to
the custom of the chancery.’' ⁷ To use the language of a later day, the
method pursued was of the common law rather than the equitable side of
the chancery, that is a plea in the Latin language, an arraignment of the
defendants, pleadings, and proof by means of an inquisition. The court,
however, was the council, from which the chancery as a body of judicature
had hardly begun to diverge.

The defence attempted to show that there had been an evasion of cus-
tom duties, 111 that the ship had stayed in the waters of Brittany through
three flows of the tide, the men even coming ashore‚ and then sailed away
in the night. The vessel, having been pursued and captured at the Scilly
Islands, was claimed as a prize of the captain of Brittany, who under his
grant of office claimed all the revenues of Brittany, such as had pertained to
the former dukes.⁸ There were two questions, therefore, before the court:
was the vessel a lawful prize ⁸? and, if so, was it a prize of the captain ’ἶ
The defence was completely swept aside by the discovery that the ship
was coming to Bristol under letters of saie-conduct. Since it was bearing
a cargo of wine, a trade specially favoured, it was entitled to come in fact
to any port. Under the Ordinance of the Staple, recently passed, foreign
merchants were promised redress against the king’s officers without being
required to sue at common law. Almost before the case was finished,
John Avenel was dismissed from the captaincy of Brittany, and another
appointed in his stead.⁹ He was afterwards convicted by the couneil, we
learn from another source, and his property confiscated to pay for the
restitution of the ship.¹⁰ His servant Wffliam Rouceby escaped further
obligation by leaving a record that he had accounted to hismaster in full
for the ship and cargo. To the Genoese merchants, in recompense for this

and other losses, a remission of the duty on 1‚000 sacks of wool was prom-
ised.1¹
