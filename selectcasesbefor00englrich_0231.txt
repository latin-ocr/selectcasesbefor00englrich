UGHTRED AND OTHERS v. MUSGRAVE ¹

Petit-ions and processes made against Thomas Musgrave‚² sheriff of
York, by Thomas Ughtred ³ and others on the Quindene of Easter in the
fortieth year of the reign of King Edward the Third.⁴

Be it remembered that the lord the king has sent before his council by
John de la Lee,⁵ steward of his household‚ divers bills delivered to him, as

[These] are the injuries and wrongs done to Thomas Ughtred, knight, by
master Thomas Musgrave sheriff of York, the which injuries he prays the
king may be redressed. ⁴

First, the said sheriff imprisoned the [said] Thomas Ughtred without pro—
cess of law or indictment, or of any manner of appeal⁶ and without warrant
contrary to law, and the said sheriff held fourteen inquests against him? and
found no cause against him for imprisoning him, and the justices of our
lord the king [both] of the peace and of the law, to wit, the lord Percy,⁸

son, and heir of Geoffrey de la Lee, of Al-
bury, Herts, sheriff of Essex and Herts in

was employed from time to time upon
special commissions issued to make in-

1311. John dela Lee sat for the county,
as John atte Lee, in the parliament of 1355
and died in 1370. He is not entered on
the roll as a knight. J. E. Cussans, Hise.

⁶ ‘¹ Accusation or Appeal is a lawful
Declaration of another man's Crime
(which by Bracton must be Felony at¹ the
least) before a competent Judge by one
that setteth his name to the Declaration,
and undertakes to prove it upon the
penalty that may ensue of the contrary.''
J. Cowell, Interpreler (ed. 1701), s. v.
Appeal.

⁸ Henry of Perey, Percehay, Pershay
&a was placed on the commission of the
peace for the West Riding of Yorkshire
on 21 March, 1361, together with Ralph
Nevill, Thomas Mosegrave, and William
Fynchesden‚ all of whose names figure in
these proceedings. (Gal. Pat. Rolls, 35 Ed.
III¹ p. 64.) A person of the same names
was nominated on the same day to the
commission of the peace for Somerset.
Henry Percy was also placed on the com-
mission for Northumberland on 20 Nov.

1362 (Pac. Rolls, 36 Ed. ΙΙΙ, p. 292). He

quisition into cases of violence as in
Northumberland on 28 Dec. 1363 (ib. p.
453), and 30 Nov. 1364 (ib. p. 530), and on
a commission of oyer and terminer in
Dorset (2 J uly‚ 1364, ib. p. 544), though
Ι have failed to find this commission. As
Percy was at the head of it, he was, per-
haps, a lawyer‚ and the same as Henry de
Percehay‚ who became a king’s serjeant in
1365, a Baron of the Exchequer in 1375,
and a Justice of the Common Pleas in
1377. E. Foss, Lives os the Jadyes, (1854),
iv, 66. Foss identifies him with a family
who were ‘¹ the possessors of Lewesham
and other manors in Yorkshire.'' But
the style here used, “le Sire de Percy‚”
nine years before the appointment of a
J'udge of the name, presents a difficulty.
The draughtsman of the pleadings may,
indeed, have awarded it, in forensia use, to
the commissioner of oyer and terminer.
There was also a Henry de Pemy, “late
lord of Spofford '' (Spofi’orth, Co. York),
who died some time prior to 15 May, 1368
(Cal. Pat. Rolls, 42 Ed. 111, p. 113). Lastly,
there was “the king’s kinsman, Hemy
lord of Percy,¹' ib. p. 172, who died 17
June, 1368. He had fought at Crdoy, and
Nevisse’s Cmss, and was much employed
