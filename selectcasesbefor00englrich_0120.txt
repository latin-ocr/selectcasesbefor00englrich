CXVl CASES BEFORE THE KINGis COUNCIL

Rome because he could not get justice elsewhere, and (3) that the king’s
letters ordering him to desist were invalid, because he himself had letters
of license. In answer to these points in detail the council argued, (1) that
it was a case of jurisdiction over persons rather than territory. The sole
judge of a dispute under the treaties of intercourse was the king, from whom
the law, so far as it was now in question, had emanated. Moreover,
according to the treaties no jurisdiction over English subjects had been
conceded, except in maritime captures.⁵ (2) As to the appeal to Rome,
Heyron had disobeyed the king’s command to desist, as expressed by letters
patent and by the procurator at Rome. Moreover, the papal sentence
settled nothing because it had been revoked. (3) As to the genuineness of
the king's letters issued at the instance of the staplers, these were wholly
valid, while the validity of the letters licensing Heyron's appeals was open
to doubt. No such letters had been issued under the great seal or under
the privy seal‚ aud, if they had been issued at all, they must have been
under the signet ring. But this could not be ascertained, because the kjng’s
secretary, the keeper of the signet at the time, was dead. If there were
any such letters in existence, the king, citing the recent action of the pope,
now revoked them. The final declaration of the council was that the
“profane and pecuniary case'’ of Richard Heyron belonged to the king's
court and no other, and here he might have audience and justice. Heyron
died soon after in sanctuary, we are told, without having recovered any of
his losses and being deeply in debt to many persons.⁶

TENANTS v. WAYNFLETE

The brief record entitled Tenants v. Waynflete is to be taken as supple-
mentary to a memorandum in the Rolls of Parliament for the previous
year.¹ It represents the last stage of a conflict that had been going on for
a year or more in the manors of Hampshire. The first that we hear of the
affair is a complaint of the bishop of Winchester that his bondmen of East
Meon had thrown off their allegiance. He invoked the Statute 5 Rich. II
against such insurrections for his protection. A commission of oyer and
terminer, dated 1 August, 1461, was granted? but so far as can be seen it
effected nothing, unless it was to excite the tenants to greater violence. The
next that we hear is that the tenants have seized the bishop as if to prevent
his escape.³ It was when Edward IV was making his first progress through
the country, as he came into Hampshire in the month of August, that the
tenants of East Meon and elsewhere “in great multitude and number ’'
came to the king complaining of certain services, customs, and dues that
the bishop and his agents were attempting to exact.⁴ The king, not having
