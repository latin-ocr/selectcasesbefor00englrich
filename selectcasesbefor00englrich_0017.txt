1. SOURCES AND MATERIAL

The king's council is one of the oldest themes of historical study and
writing. In the fifteenth century it was noticed by Sir John Fortescue, in
his Governance of Εης]ἷαηᾶ,1 the earliest attempt at a constitutional treatise.
Because of its connexion with the problems of law under the Tudors and
the Stuarts, it was a subject of special interest to the jurists of the period,
such as William Ηιιείεοη,2 Julius Caesar,³ John Cowell‚⁴¹ Thomas Smith,⁵
Edward Coke,⁶ and Matthew Hale,⁷ who saw its connexion with the Court
of Requests and the Court of Star Chamber. In the nineteenth century it
was given due prominence in the works of Nicolas, Palgrave‚ Dicey,
Stubbs, and Maitland. Each one according to the learning of his age has
brought the subject a step further into the light, until it is by no means one
of the least known of all our legal and political institutions. But up to the
present time there has not been published any comprehensive collection of
cases before the king and council, upon which not only the history of the
council, but also in proportional measure the history of law must depend.
Although in inverse order, this was the necessary sequence of events, for it
is only gradually that such cases have been discovered, and only with the
aid of many collateral publications can they be studied to advantage.

The difficulty of reaching the records has been considerable, for the
council was distinctly not a court of record; it kept no regular roll; it main-
tained no system of collecting or preserving its records. Written for an
immediate purpose, the memoranda of its cases were scattered and lost,
except as they have been preserved among the miscellaneous papers of the
chancery and the exchequer. Many of these cases, it is true, have been
