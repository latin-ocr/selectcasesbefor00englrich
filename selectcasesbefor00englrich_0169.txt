BISHOP 01· SABINA v. BEDEWYNDE 23

any part damaged‚ but are confirmed by a genuine lead seal hanging by
threads of silk as was evident upon the face ; and having with the aid of
John, the aforesaid notary carefully collated this transcript or exem-
plification with the said letters, I have faithfully read and compared
them, and since the two are found to agree in all points, in testimony of
this I have given my signature and have added my customary sign Ἠ
along with the seal of the said court of Paris and the sign of the afore-
said John, notary, under the aforesaid year, Indiction⁷ month, day,
pontifinate, and place.‘-'⁹
And the aforesaid Walter says that the sixth of the Ides of May in
the third year of the pontificate of the said Pope Boniface was the tenth
day of the same month of May, in the year of grace 1297, and of the present
king’s reign 25th, when the temporalities of the aforesaid archbishop were
in the hand of the said lord the king, and he adds that notwithstanding
that the aforesaid treasurership by reason of the said vacancy (created)
by deprivation had been bestowed by the supreme pontiff upon the afore-
said Theobald de Bar or another, this ought not to prejud'ice the lord the
king or the interest which the said Walter now has in the said treasurership,
especially because this collation at that time belonged by right of the
crown etc. to the king himself, and the king himself in this matter has this
especial prerogative that in matters of this kind pertaining to his royal
right ete. there is no lapse³⁰ of time against him, nor ought there to be, so
that the rights etc., and if for a time they shall fall in abeyance or be neg-
lected, without his being consulted or in any wise giving attention, he can
recover them and use them whenever he pleases etc„ and (since) the said
Walter holds the said treasurership by collation of the king himself for the
time when of right etc. the collation belonged to the king himself just as
has been already explained. Furthermore as to the point contained in the
aforesaid petition that the aforesaid Theobald de Bar by collation of the
aforesaid supreme pontifi possessed in peace the aforesaid treasurership on
the deprivation of the aforesaid John de Sancto Vito etc., he says that
although the said supreme pontiff upon the induction of the said Theobald
into the said treasurership had deputed certain persons as executors etc„
and the said executors by eomminatory letters had commanded that the
said Theobald should be inducted into the corporal possession of the afore-
said treasurership to hold with all its rights and appurtenances etc„ (yet)
the dean and chapter of the aforesaid church of York to whom the execu-
tion of such mandates pertained, although they did not dare to contravene
or resist the apostolic commands‚ believing nevertheless that the aforesaid
collation and induction would be to the prejudice of the lord the king, since
the collation etc. belonged to the lord the king himself by reason of the
vacancy etc.‚ then publicly protested that so far as it pertained to them they
were unwilling to prejudice the lord the king by the admission of the said
Theobald, whereby it is plain that the said Theobald had no lawful estate
