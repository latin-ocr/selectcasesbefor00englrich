BISHOP OF SABINA v. BEDEWYNDE 26

the part of the said Francis that the said treasurership was not vacant dur-
ing the said voidance of the archbishopric, wherefore the lord the king be-
stowed it upon the said Walter, and since Walter himself claims no other
estate in regard to it than that of the said collation eta, (therefore) it
seems to the kingâ€™s council that the said Walter is right in his possession
thereos etc. Hereupon it was agreed that the aforesaid Francis should
recover nothing by his aforesaid petition. And it was enjoined upon the
aforesaid Walter under forfeiture of all that he can forfeit to the king, that
with all diligence and with all his might he should maintain and defend the
right of the lord the king to the aforesaid collat-ion and his own possession
of the said treasurership, and also that he should sue to the lord the king
and his council for aid in the matter etc. whenever it should seem expedient.
It was also agreed that letters should be issued to him out of the chancery,
whatever might be necessary etc. for the defense of his possession etc. And
report is to be made to the lord the king upon the premises in the following
words:

Sire, in regard to what you have commanded us, that having heard the
statement made before us and the others of your council by the honour-
able father in God, Peter, by the grace of God bishop of Sabina, cardinal
of the holy church of Rome, in behalf of the late treasurer of the church
of York, in regard to the right to the said treasurership, we inform you
that having heard the statement made by a clerk in behalf of the said
cardinal before us and your justices and the others of your council at
London, and having examined the said matter well and diligently, we
find that the said treasurership was vacant during the voidanee of the
archbishopric of York caused by the death of John le Romein, formerly
archbishop there, and that the temporalities of the said archbishopric
were (then) in your hand. And because, Sire, the collation of benefices
during such vacancies belongs to you, and because no lapse of time
affects you in such case, it seems to us and to your justices and others of
your council that the collation of the said treasurership belonged to you
by right of your crown, and that you can and should give it at your
pleasure, just as you have done without wronging anyone, and that
your gift, Sire, is reasonable according to the right of your crown. May
the Lord, Sire, grant- you good long life, and increase your honours.
Given at Westminster the 22nd day of June.

Afterwards the Lord King Edward, son of the said king, sent here his
writ under the privy seal which is among the common matters of the second
year and runs as follows:

Edward, by the grace of God king of England, lord of Ireland and duke
of Aquitaine, to the deputy of our treasurer and the barons of our
