to inform the said council upon the premises. Upon this day the aforesaid
John came before the council and said that the aforesaid ship tarried in the
aforesaid port through three flows and ebbs of the tide, as has been de-
scribed, while the master and mariners of the said ship, having been re-
quired by the aforesaid admiral in behalf of the king to pay the aforesaid
customs there, on coming to land under safe conduct, promised that they
would corne to land there on the morrow to pay the custom3 and because
the next night they sailed away with the aforesaid ship without paying the
aforesaid customs, the aforesaid William as a retainer of the aforesaid John
and under the direction of his said admiral pursued the aforesaid ship, and
captured it near the aforesaid islands with the aforesaid merchandise as a
prize of the aforesaid captain's, just as has been told, while for the said ship
and merchandise he accounted with the aforesaid John and answered for
these fully to the said John, as has been told before. And the aforesaid
William was given in custody to Philip of Whitton,⁷ to be brought before
the council of our lord the king whenever this should be required in behalf
of the king. And the aforesaid John was afterwards commanded by writ
of the lord the king to be before the king in his chancery on the morrow of
the Lord’s Ascension ⁸ in the twenty-ninth year of our lord the king to hear
his judgment upon the premises. And the said John appeared in the said
chancery at Westminster upon the aforesaid day, and the aforesaid process
having been read and rehearsed before John himself, in the presence of
John archbishop of York, chanoellor,⁹ William bishop of Winchester, treas-
urer‚¹⁰ also the justices of both benches an'd others of the said council, it
was adjudged that the aforesaid John should be taken and committed to
the lord the king's prison in the Tower of London‚ and that his goods and
chattels should be seized into the king's hand, until he should answer to the
lord the king for the aforesaid ship and goods and chattels. So that if it
shall have been proved that the aforesaid ship and goods and chattels for
the aforesaid cause have been forfeited to the king as his persona] property,
on the ground that the said ship and goods were found and captured within
the dominion of the king of England, the money forthcoming from the afore-
said property shall be kept; but if at the suit of the aforesaid merchant it
shall have been proved that the aforesaid ship, goods and chattels have
not been forfeited in the aforesaid manner, then the said lord the king shall
answer to the aforesaid merchant for the aforesaid value.¹¹
