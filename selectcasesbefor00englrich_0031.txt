INTRODUCTION XXV

For another half-century then, in all equitable cases the attendance of the
council was still regarded as necessary. Sometimes there were present the
same lords and knights who were prominent in political work.1 But the
number gradually shrinks to the formal attendance of a few advisere, pos-
sibly only two justioes, before the semblance of a conciliar body disappears
entirely. There is an instance in 1458, wherein the decree is set down as
pronounced “ by the chancellor with the advice of the justices of either
bench.” ² After this the position of the chancellor as sole judge is rapidly
reached. In 8 Edward IV he declares that he holds two jurisdictions, the
one of common law, the other of equity; here the chaneellor calls himself a
judge.³ In 14 Edward IV there is a clear example of an equitable decree
given by the chancellor alone, and other instances soon follow.⁴ This was
not the last of councillors in attendance and there was still an inclination in
this connexion to speak of the court rather than the chancellor. But the
separate growth of the chancellor’s equitable jurisdiction is no longer to be
doubted. The nature of this jurisdiction and its derivation from the prac-
tices of the oouncil will be discussed a little later.

Another problem in the development of the chancery is helped toward
solution by the records of our cases. It has always been a question how far
the clerical estate of the chancellors, for with slight exception they were
invariably elergymen, affected their judicial position. Also to what extent
did they draw upon their knowledge of canon law and the practices of
ecclesiastical courts in creating the jurisdiction of the chancery ? For the
most part the evidence on these material points is extremely elusive. But
there is a suggestive incident in our memorandum of The Consession os
Willz'am chamberlain in 1383 (p. 71), wherein it is told how a man who had
been drawn into an attempt to forge a testament‚ feeling pangs of remorse,
went to the archbishop of Canterbury then chancellor and made to him a
complete confession. The chancellor laid it upon the guilty man as a
penance to withdraw from his confederates and then to go to the church
where the testator was buried and confess the wrong. This confession we
are told he went forth and made before the whole parish. The records
rarely tell us as much, but it is altogether likely that many a case of moral
right or wrong was settled in some such way, without formal proceedings,
by the imposition of a penance, or even a word of persuasion or reproach.
The remaining question of the influence of canonical law will be touched
upon in the following sections on jurisdiction and procedure.
