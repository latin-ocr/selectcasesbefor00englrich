² Thomas de Musgrave was pricked
sheriff of the county of York on 30 Sep-
tember, 1359. On 21 November, 1360,
Marmaduke Conestahle displaeed him;
but on 20 November, 1362, Musgrave was
appointed sheriff once more, and remained
in office till 13 May, 1366, when Cones-
table again succeeded him. After this
date, his name does not recur. His final
displacement was, therefore, not improb-
ahly due to these petitions, 10 which the
judgment 01 the couneil, though fragmen-
tary‚ appears to have been favourable.
The quindeno of Easter, 40 Edward III,
was 19 April, 1366, to which date these
petitions are assigned. Is Musgrave's
displacement were their consequence, the
business of the council was expeditiously
transacted.

Thomas Musgmve, sheriff of York, is
identified with Sir Thomas Musgrave,
Baron Musgrave, by the author 01 the 1118
01 1118 latter in the Dici. Nat. Bftoy. This
document, however, furnishes ground 101·
the conclusion that the sheriff was son of
his more distinguished father 01 the same
names. For the Thomas Musgrave, who
was ‘¹ in 1368 and subsequent years es-
01180101 for Yorkshire, Northumberland,
Cumberland, and Westmorland‚’¹ was, as

the Patentv Rolls shew, not. a knight, but
probably the sheriff 3 whereas Sir Thomas
Musgravc was a soldier, constantly em-
ployed in the defence of the border against
the Scots. In the same membrane (6) 01
the Patent Rolls of 44 Ed. ΙΙΙ, pt. I,
occurs the name of “Thomas de Musgrave,
escheator in the county of York’' (15
May) and (20 May) “Thomas de Mus-
grave, chivaler''; apparently indicating
different persons. From this family are
descended the Musgraves of Edenhall,
Cumberland.

³ The name 01 Ughtred, 01 Scarborough
and Catton, &c., County York, was one of
great distinction at this time. The father
01 this petitioner, Sir Thomas Ughtred, K.
G„ was summoned to parliament as a
baron in 1343 and 1364, and had died in
1365. Η15 son and heir, already a knight,
became a distinguished commander both
in Scotland, where he was governor 01
Lochmaben Casae, and in France, and
died in November, 1401, but was never
summoned to parliament. Sir T. C. Banks,
