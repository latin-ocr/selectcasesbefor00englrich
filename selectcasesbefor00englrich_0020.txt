XlV CASES BEFORF, THE KING’S COUNCIL

classifieation other than the bundles in which they have been preserved.
In none of our cases has there been any success in finding a related petition
in ehancery. A very important collection of the chancery, compiled in
recent years, is known as Parliamentary and Councz'l Proceedz'nys, which
eonsists of miscellaneous matter, such as petitions‚ draughts of ordinances
and statutes, records of cases, &c some of which are the originals of what
is contained in the Parliaxnent Rolls. Several of our earlier cases come from
this source. But as council and parliament grew apart, these materials are
more parliamentary and less conciliar. It is otherwise with a parallel com-
pilation of Parlz'amemary (md Council Proceedinys taken from the Excheq-
uer. This consists of documents similar to the former, which for adminis-
trative reasons were given into the custody of the king's remembrancer. As
the exchequer instead of the chancery became the regular depository of
the council, it is altogether natural that typical cases of the fifteenth cen-
tury should be found here. It is by an acquaintance with the administra-
tivo methods of the couneil, that its records can best be traced. From the
time of Riehard ΙΙ its secretarial work was regularly performed by clerks
of the privy seal⁷ its acts were normally carried into execution by writs of
the privy seal, and so among· the files of this department the records of its
judieial and other proceedings are most likely to be found. Particularly a
series known as Warrants, Council and Privy Sea] (Exehequer, T. R.) is
made up of letters under the signet, letters and orders unsealed, which were
received by the keeper as warrants for the issue of letters under the privy
seal. In the ease of The Bedsord Rz'ot (infra, p. 104) we are fortunate enough
to have the original record of the office of the privy seal as well as an exem-
plification in the ehaneery. But outside of the regular depositories conciliar
doeuments have been met in the most unexpeeted places. In one instance
the review of an admiralty case, probably because it was referred to in
foreign correspondenoe, is found among Dzssplomatz'c Documents (Chaucery).¹

2. CHOICE AND PRESENTATION

So far as choice is practicable, the effort of the editors has been to present
a variety of cases, in order to illustrate as many problems of law and pro-
cedure as possible. Not only completed records, therefore, but also frag-
ments of litigation, particularly petitions with their endorsements, con-
fessions and examinations, have been utilized for the purpose. Whenever
it has been possible, the connexion with an earlier or later stage of litigation
has been shewn in the notes. A consequent writ is often a valuable addition
to the simple record. Moreover, as legislation and judicature were never
separate in the mind of the council, the cases often have a bearing upon the
statutes and other matters of public policy. Thus the case of the Bishop os
Sabina v. Bedewynde (p. 18), in connexion with others of the same kind,
