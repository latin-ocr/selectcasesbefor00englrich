CONFESSION AND EXAMINATION OF JOHN FORDE

The Examination os John Forde in 1439 is an example of the zeal of the
oouncil in enforcing the regulations of the wool trade. These regulations
were infinitely specific as to packing, weighing, sealing, cocketing, etc.‚ in
proportion to the ingenious methods of merchants to evade and defraud the
cuswms. One of the common devices of illicit traders, colloquially known
as “ good packing,'’ was to mix or wind in better wool with cheaper wool,
in order to pay the lower custom duties. This offence was dealt with in the
Statute 8 Henry VI, c. 22, to the effect that no wool-packer should make
within the realm aught but good and due packing, or make any inwinding
within the fleece of wools at the rolling up of the wool, etc. The present
case reveals a variation of this practice, not noticed before, in the device of
winding the raw wool in the folds of woolen eloth. There was every temp-
tation to do this, for the statutes requiring the wool of the realm to be
exported only to Calais,¹ had been made increasingly stringent, while
licenses to export wool to other places were difficult to get. On the other
hand the exportation of woolen eloth, noticed from the beginning of the
fifteenth century, was liberally encouraged and exempted from the limi-
tations placed on raw wool.² The statutes of Edward IV were to go further
in restricting the exportation of wool in favour of that of cloth. The revela-
tions of John Forde stimulated the government to search packages of cloth
for inwindings of wool and enabled it to detect others in the same illicit
practices. A few months later John Cok another mercer of London was
found out and arrested for packing wool with his cloth for 5111111118111.3
Different from Forde, he was pardoned 011 1115 petition that he had been
instigated by evil-doers who had thus attempted to destroy him, but the
king confiscated the wool and the eloth. A series of commissions to Lord
Cmmwell, Robert Large, William Fallan, the examiners in the present
case, to search for the “ forcing and clacking ’' and other illegal practices
in the wool trade apparently had a salutary effect.⁴¹

THE BEDFORD RIOT

The Examination into the Bedsord Riot brings us to an episode presaging
the worst days of the Paston Letters. In a manner characteristic of the
fifteenth century, it sprang from a dissension between two of the leading
lords of Bedfordshire. One was Lord Grey of Ruthin,¹ of an ancient family
with an accumulation of estates in Bedfordshire‚ Buckinghamshire, and
