VALENCE v. BISHOP OF WORCESTER 6

commands in this matter, he issued against them a sentence of the greater
excommunication ⁸ in contempt of the king and to the hurt of the king's
royal dignity⁹ and contrary to his oath made to the king and to his crown.¹⁰
From this sentence indeed the aforesaid William, William, Simon, Geoffrey,
and Thomas appealed to the protection of the court of the see of Canter-
bury‚¹¹ as is manifestly clear by certain letters patent signed with the seal of
the official ¹² of the court aforesaid exhibited and read before the king and
his council. And because the cognizances and corrections of such liberties
or of injuries done to the same specially pertain to the king’s crown and
dignity, and the aforesaid bishop is attempting to usurp the cognizances
and corrections of this liberty to the disherison of the king and to the mani-
fest injury of the crown and the king's dignity which the king neither will
nor ought to suffer nor is the king willing to leave such contempt and
trespass unpunished, (the precept issued was) to distrain without delay
the aforesaid bishop throughout all the bishop's lands and tenements held
of the king in his bailiwick, so that neither the bishop himself nor any
one of himself should lay hand upon them ¹³ until the king should otherwise
issue his precept to him in that behalf, and that he should have the same
bishop in his proper person here before the king at this day, to wit, in the
octave of Saint Hilary¹⁴ to answer to the king touching the contempt and
trespass aforesaid, and to do and to receive further that which the king's
court- shall have decreed in this behalf. And now comes the aforesaid
bishop and likewise Roger de Ingepenne¹5 who prosecutes for the king and
he says that on Tuesday next before the gule of August ¹⁶ in the twenty-first
year of the reign of the king ¹⁷ that now is‚the aforesaid bishop of Worcester
by his deans¹⁸ made a certain inquisition to inquire who had taken a certain
robber, Thomas by name, in Little Interberge within his liberty to the

chief secretary of the prelate, who was
appointed, not as a mere or special dele-
gate, but as judge ordinary, to execute all
the jurisdiction inherent in the person of
the bishop, or archbishop, his principal.

¹⁵ This name is not among those of the
counsel or judges given in Foss, but from
the Calemiar os Patent Rolls 27 Ed. I, p.
445, it would seem that he was a depend-
ant of Aylmer of Valence. On 16 Octo-
ber, 1299, Valence took out a patent of
protection for himself, Roget lnkepenne,
and Roget Inkepenne the younger, going
with him beyond seas (ib. ἃ cf. p. 420).

A pedigree of the family is to be found in
Sir J. Maclean’s Htst. os Triyy *Minor
(1876), ii, 43; but it appears to have
derived from Inkepenne in Berkshire,
where Roger de Inkepenne held half a fee.

1292. Roger de Inkpenne's name occurs
in connexion with a Cornish ease in Flac.
