l CASES BEFORE THE KING5s COUNCIL

contain foui· cases in which he is accused of perverting justice. That his
conduct must have been exceptionally scandalous is to be inferred from
the fact that the fine imposed upon him, the huge sum of 32100, was third
in order of magnitude of those exacted from the ten principal (161111011161115.2

After this time 116 ceased to be employed as a judge. Two other persons
mentioned in this bill of complaint also appear in the above-mentioned
State Trials Hugh le Taylour files a complaint against Sir John de Wotton,³
who had been sheriff of Wilts in 1281, and his complaint is 511666551111.4 It
is not a violent inference that, assuming the story told by Taylor in the
present case to be true, Wotton's conduct was prompted by personal ani-
mosity. The local names suggest that the complainant and defendant
may have been neighbours. Wotton is, it is true, a not uncommon place-
name. But it happens that the place of that name in Wiltshire, known as
Wotton-Basset, is only ten miles from Wanborough, where Sir John seized
some of the complainant's chattels. Of the nominal plaintiff, John de
Tauy, in the proceedings of which Taylor complains, we hear nothing,
except that he was the stalking-horse employed by Rochester. An exe-
cution was levied on Taylor’s lands for the large sum of 2640. The demand,
indeed, was for „4:50 and, inasmuch as Taylor alleges that there were other
goods to satisfy the claim, it is not clear why the sheriff's bailiff elected to
commit an illegality by seizing the beasts of plough while neglecting to
realize the sum sued for. At any rate, it is alleged that, although the law
forbade the. seizure of beasts of plough, and even laid upon justices in eyre
the duty of inquiring into statutory offences of this kind, Rochester, him-
self a justice in cyre, sanctioned these proceedings. The plaintiff estimates
his losses at 3922. A comparison of his figures, unfortunately incomplete,
with those of the prices of stock published by Thorold Rogers in his H istory
os Agriculture and Priccs shews that his estimates erred on the side of
moderation. Of the offence of maintenance, with which Rochester is
charged, a common mode of oppression in the Middle Ages, enough is
said in the notes. It long survived the fines and penalties inflicted by the
retributive justice of King Edward Ι.

VALENCE v. BISHOP OF WORCESTER

1294 The case of William of Valence against Godfrey Giffard, bishop of
Worcester, is one of those thought by Hale worthy of transcription into his
MS. collection. It has this feature of interest among others, that it was
heard by the king and council when the court was at Estry, near Sandwich,
Kent, in 1294. The protagonists were personages of the first rank, the
