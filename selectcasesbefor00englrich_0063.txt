at least it might have been claimed as a spiritual function and then it would
have reverted to a clerical authority. Madox,¹⁷ who has assembled much
material on the rights of the king over vacant bishoprics‚ has said nothing
on this point. Yet the power was well established in the thirteenth cen-
tury. In 1234 a case was heard that tested the right of the crown in a
question of this kind.¹⁸ The bishop-elect of Heresord, having been duly
confirmed by the archbishop of Canterbury, on the same day conferred a
prebend pertaining to the bishopric on a candidate of his own choice. But
the king, having learned that the former holder had died while the tem-
poralities of the bishopric were still in hand, bestowed the prebend upon
another candidate. The bishop argued in the king's court that he had
found the place vacant, and so he could and ought to fill it. But it was the
judgment of the court, concurred in by the archbishop of Canterbury and
other bishops in attendance, that the king's donation was undoubtedly
valid, although they could point to no custom, and no such case had been
heard of before.¹⁹ The case is important for setting an exact precedent
for the claim afterwards made in the case of the Bishop os Sabina v. Bede-
wynde, although the pope was not then involved and other complications
of the later case were lacking.

In the reign of Edward I the question of provisors became a pressing
one, but there was lacking at first any firm policy in dealing with it. Be-
tween the alternatives of accepting or rejecting the papal candidates the
king seemed to vacillate, according as he was moved by desire of the friend-
ship of the pope, or constrained by his barons to oppose him. In 1290 with
the support of his barons Edward sent a letter to the pope complaining of
abuses in the matter of “ collations and executions ⁷' in the churches of York
and Lincoln tending to the disinheritance of the crown.2⁰ But the answer of 2
Nicholas IV, admonishing him not to invade the liberties and rights of the
church‚²¹ was received without protest. Again in 1295 Edward writes to
Boniface VIII, who has asked for two prebends in the church of York, that
he is desirous out of reverence for the pope of carrying the matter into
effect, so far as may be done without disinheritance of the crown.2² At the .
same time the king is secking a reciprocal favour for his relative Theobald
of Bar bishop-elect of Metz.2³ But the king was capable of asserting the
rights of the crown with greater vigour. During the vacancy of the see of
York, occasioned by the death of Archbishop Romein in 1296, Edward
conferred the prebend of Masham upon his clerk John of Drockensford‚
who was inducted and held possession for two years. Then on grounds
