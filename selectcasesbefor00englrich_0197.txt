tification or the partition made in the same pretended certification and all
things contained in it should be held as null, and that the aforesaid fiefs and
advowsons shall continuously remain and ought to remain in the hand of
the lord the king from the time of the death of the aforesaid Eva, until a
partition, of these among the parceners of the aforesaid inheritance be made
in the aforesaid chancery, and that the aforesaid William, who has with-
drawn from court without a license, should be taken for the aforesaid
falsification; wherefore a commission was issued to Thomas atte Ferye,
serjeant at arms of the lord the king, to take the said William and bring
him to the Tower of London there to stay in prison until the king shall
ordain otherwise concerning him, and he was amerced in lOOs. for the

REX v. WILLIAM ROUCEBY AND JOHN AVENEL¹

Be it remembered that concerning the capture of a certain ship named
“The Saint Mary of Coronade '¹ from Genoa and certain goods and chattels
found in the said ship, at the suit of Anthony Compaignon,2 merchant of
Genoa,³ William of Rouceby having been impeached came into the king's
chancery at Westminster, and he says that the aforesaid ship came into The
Race of St. Matthew in Brittany and there tarried through three flows and
ebbs of the tide, while the mariners of the aforesaid ship, having failed to
pay the customs due to the aforesaid lord the king of England in the afore-
said port on the merchandise carried in the same ship, sailed away with the
same ship by night, wherefore the said William as one of the retainers of
John Avenel, captain and lieutenant of the lord the king in the duchy of
Brittany,⁴ following the aforesaid ship by order of Thomas of Lyndelowe,
admiral of the said John Avenel in the aforesaid duchy, captured the said
ship together with the aforesaid merchandise near the Scilly Islands in
Cornwall, (taking these) for the aforesaid cause as a prize of the said cap-
tain's according to the custom of those regions, accounting for the same to
the aforesaid John Avenel and answering to him for them ; wherefore he
does not think that he ought to be haled at the suit of the said Anthony for
the capture of the aforesaid ship and goods and chattels.⁵ Hereupon the
aforesaid John was commanded to be before the king‘s council a week after
bo meet with the refractory captains
(Ibid. R. III, i, 261). In November he

was called upon to publish a truce con-
cluded with Charles of Blois a claimant

shortly altem-ard assumed the guardian-
ship of the young Duke John. To govern
the duchy there was appointed first Sir
Thomas Dagworth as the king's captain

and lieutenant, then in 1350 Sir Walter
Bentley, and after him in April, 1353, the
present John Avenel, a knight of Bedford-
shire (Tout, Pol. Hist„ 357, 381; Foe-
dera, R. ΙΙΙ, i, 257; O. v, 687, 754). He
met with some disobedience in the duchy
which caused the king to send emissaries

for the duchy <Ibid. 269).

⁶ Fr0m the writ of 22 Jan. just men-
tioned we learn more of the facts connected
with the capture. While in pursuit of the
Genoese ship, Rouceby fell in with or
picked up four other ships, so that it was
a fleet of five ships that over-took the
