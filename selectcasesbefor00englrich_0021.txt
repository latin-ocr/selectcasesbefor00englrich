INTRODUCTION XV

led directly to the Statute of Provisors. Rex v. M iddleton (p. 35) has little
value as a question of law, but it was connected with an extensive reform in
the appointment of sheriffs and escheators. Uqhtred v. Musqrave (p. 54)
was a step in the gradual diminution of the judicia] powers of the sheriffs.
Giffard v. M orlon (p. 107) was antecedent to a statute. Every case indeed
has its special bearing upon some larger problem. So far as this has been
learned, it has been made the subject of treatment in the notes and com-
ments set down in the second part of the Introduction.

The Latin and French languages were both used by the council alter-
nately and interchangeably, until the appropriateness of the former to
matters of common law and of the latter to proceedings in equity was per-
ceived. After the method of previous volumes of the Selden Society these
texts have been translated upon the right-hand pages. English texts of the
fifteenth century can easily be read with the aid of a few footnotes. After
some hesitation it has seemed best to keep proper names as a rule in their
contemporary form. There is a temptation in the translation to modernize
such forms as “ Bedewyndess’ ‘¹ Leveys‚'’ ‘¹ Atte Wode,’⁷ “ Broket,” &c
In a literary work “ Bedwin,‘⁷ “ Atwood,'⁷ ἀς. would be preferable, but in
matters of record there are reasons in favour of the archaic spelling. It is
true, spelling was by no means uniform. In the same record a name appears
both as “ Stafferton '³ and “ Staverton‚'’ “ Poche ” and “ Poucheff’ Still
there was a preferred spelling and the likelihood is that “ Conyngsby ” will
be more accurately traced under this form than “ Coningsby '' and “ Hey-
ron '¹ than ‘¹ Heron.'y A certain deference to the correcter form of a name
was sometimes shown, as in the case of William “ Esturmy alias Sturmy.’'

3. THE COUNCIL AS A COURT

In the controversy that raged around the Court of Star Chamber in the
seventeenth century, it was questioned whether the king’s council was in
any proper sense a law court, or had any judicia] authority apart from the
statutes defining it.¹ In view of what has since been written, no one will
doubt that the council was a court resting upon the most substantia] his-
torical foundations. But what were its judicial functions, to what extent
and in what manner were they exercised, are still a matter of inquiry. To
what extent, are we to believe, did the council undertake the hearing of
cases ⁴? It is a question of some moment whether the cases collected in the
present volume are to be regarded as illustrations of a jurisdiction regularly
-exercised, or as instances of an infrequent and exceptional intervention.

Sir Edward Coke, writing on the antecedents of the Star Chamber, pro-
pounded the following view: “ This court in ancient times sat rarely, for
three causes: First, for that enormous and exorbitant causes which this
court dealt withall only in these days rarely fell out. Seconffly, this court
