derby, John Fitz, and Harry Etwell‚ the justices named in the record now
at hand. Then there came a collision between the justices of this commis-
sion and the regular justices of the peace represented by Lord Fanhope,
William Ludsop, and William Peck. On this occasion Lord Grey, who was
near the end of his life, took no active part. The justices of the special
commission were about to begin their session in the town hall of Bedford‚
when Lord Fanhope with 40 or 60 armed men came into the hall, and after
a brief greeting sat down on a bench at the end of the room. There was
an attempt to bring the justices of both commissions together, but between
the two sides there was an exchange of rudeness, arguments, threats, and
words of defiance‚ until the hall was filled with clamour. Lord Fanhope
leaped upon the board used as a table and drew his dagger. Enderby also
held a dagger until a sword was handed to him. There were hundreds of
armed men in the neighbourhood. Yet in all this tumult, or riot as it was
called, no one was injured, not even a blow was struck by either side
against the other.⁷

Wauton and his fellows immediately carried out their threat of reporting
the matter to the king and council. Their certification,⁸ which is mentioned
in our record, is unfort-unately wanting. Not to be outdone, Lord Fanhope
h'kewise made a certification, accusing his opponents of breaking up the
session of the peace which he had endeavoured to hold. And so the council
took up the matter on 10 February, in the proceedings now before us.
The examination before the lords in the star chamber was the most com-
plete and searching that has yet been recorded. On the facts alleged in
the certification of the justices as many as thirteen articles of inquiry were
drawn up. The witnesses, including the four justices of the first commis-
sion and the undersheriff of Bedfordshire, were questioned singly and
their answers written down. When their answers and admissions were
afterwards read and compared, it was found that Wauton and Enderby
had disagreed over the form of the certification. There was a discrepancy
in the testimony as to the number of Lord Fanhope’s followers. The jus-
tices admitted that they had not announced to his lordship their intention
of opening the session and had hardly shown him due reverence. Much
was made of the question whether Fanhope held his dagger downward or
forward, whether his attitude and motions were threatening, and whether
he had incited the tumult or sought to quell it. Fitz saw him draw no
dagger and Enderby admitted having drawnhis own. They all acknowl-
edged that his lordship had sought to quell the riot, that he had protected
them in going to their lodging, and had hospitably given them drink.
When the record was finally read in the presence of many lords of the coun-
cil, it was their opinion that, while they could not legally deny the certifi-
