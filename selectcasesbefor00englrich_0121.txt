the leisure then to examine into the matter, charged the peasants to con-
tinue their services and payments as before, and if they felt themselves
injured to send deputies to the next parliament when they should be heard
and have answer according to reason. At the same time, according to one
account, the king rescued the bishop from the hands of his captors and
arrested their ringleaders.⁵ On their coming to parliament, which met
4 November, the claims of the peasants were referred to a body of lawyers,
three serjeants, and the king’s attorney, who were to examine into the
matter with the aid of the learned counsel of both sides and report to the
king and the house of lords. After long labour a copious detail of partic-
ulars was given to the Iords on 14 December. The grievances of the
peasants, it now appears, were

(1) The exactiori of certain customs of hens and corn under the name
of Shirshette, otherwise known as Church Scot.

(2) The exaction of a sum of money claimed at two law days of the
year called Tithing penny or Totting penny.

(3) The levy of a sum called custom pannage ⁶ for swine in East Meon.

(4) That the court of the bishop had been held at the parsonage of East
Meon and not within the manor.

(5) As to their status, the tenants claim to be freeholders, not copy-
holders, and their land charter land, not copy land.

These claims were dem'ed by the bishop entirely. The lords took until
the next morning to deliberate, when it was intended that every man
should be asked for his advice. The proofs laid before them consisted of
records of the manor, particularly court rolls and account books called
Pipes ⁷ of as many as fifteen bishops, also records of the chancery and the
exchequer, by which it was determined after long and serious debate that
the claims of the bishop were fully sustained and that the tenants had failed
to show sufficient cause for exemption. The decree was passed by the
lords on 16 December, in the presence of the justices of both benches, and
assented to by the king.

But the matter did not end here. Whether the tenants showed new
signs of rebellion, we do not know. But in the month of May they‘were
complaining again that the bishop had thrown certain of their neighbours
into prison. Both parties were told to send deputies before the king's
council. The tenants came, but satisfied that the court was against them,
departed and lost their case by default. After the writs of proclamation
determined, as is here told, on 3 July, no'further attempts, so far as is
known, were made by the tenants of East Meon.
