INTRODUCTION 1111111

1101 1110 case was heard because the defendant was a sheriff. The first case
of maintenance in fact to be given a complete hearing was Esturmy v.
Courteva (p. 77), and from that time others follow in rapid succession.

That the 00011011 should exercise any jusisdiction of the kind was reluc-
tantly admitted in the statutes. The numerous statutes against mainte·
nance and liveries‚ 20 Edw. III, 13 Ric. II, 16 Ric. ΙΙ, 7 Hen. IV, etc.‚ rely
not upon the couneil but upon justices of assize and justices of the peace
for their enforcement. The Statute 13 Hen. IV, 0. 7, against riots seems to
strike a new note in declaring that in default of the justices of the peace
certification shall be made to the king and council, and punishment of the
rioters shall be inflicted at their discretiori. The act further provides that
if the trespassers do not appear at the first precept, another precept shall
be issued to the sheriff to bring thern before the 00011011 01 1110 king’s bench;
and if this means fail, then proclamation is to be made for the transgressors
to appear before the king and 00011011, 1110 king's bench, or the chancery.
But whatever authority was given to the council by this act was taken away
by the Statute 2 Hen. V, lst, 0. 8, which reverted to former methods in
placing the enforcement of the law preferably in the hands of special com-
missions. Again the Statute 8 Edw. IV, c. 2, the most vigorous act yet
passed against liveries, specifies the king's bench, the court of common
pleas, the justices of the peace, and commissioners of oyer and terminer; it
goes far to legitimatize in the courts extraordinary procedure by bill, in-
formation and examination, but it carefully avoids designating the council.
Only in vague language did parliament recognize the authority of the
council in this class of cases, as in the proviso to an act of 1 Ric. Π, “unless
it be against such high personages that right cannot be done elsewhere ’⁷ ; ¹
and again, “ unless there be too much might on the one side and unmight
on the other.'' Moreover a survey of the petitions shews that the council
was not popularly regarded as the only court for such suits. Quite as many
petitions of this kind were addressed to parliament on this score; and the
earliest petitions in chancery were of the same character. But parliament,
which was reluctant to pass any general act to this effect, persistently
referred individua] cases to the couneil, e. g. Atte Wode v. Clifford (p. 86).
At the close of the first parliament of Henry VI an entire file of ¹‘ riot bi11s”
was thus turned over. It was therefore by custom and general acquiescence
that this part of the council's jurisdiction was established before the
Statute 3 Hen. VII expressly mentions ‘¹ maintenance‚ liveries, signs and
tokens, 1013111015, 11015 3οᾱ unlawful assemblages '’ as pertaining to the
council sitting in the star chamber.

There is a remaining question, how far the eouncil shared in the develop-
ment of the equitable jurisdiction that flourished most widely under the
chancellors in the fifteenth century. There is no longer any contention that
equity originated with the chancellors or with any particular court. It is
