xlii CAsns BEFORE THE KING’S COUNCIL

could be brought in by writ of certiorari. Juries were never directly em-
ployed; if the verdict of a jury was required, a writ of inquisition was
issued to a sheriff. Witnesses were usually not necessary, but were cited
and examined whenever wanted. If more searching means were necessary,
the parties and witnesses were put under oath to tell the truth, and then
were snbjected to an inquisitorial examination, a method that will be dis·
cussed in connexion with criminal trials. By such means, it will be seen,
the council and the chancery were peculiarly well fitted for eliciting evi-
dence in the equitable cases of trusts and verbal agreements, which were
quite elusive to the methods of the common law.

In criminal trials the defendant was required to come in person and
answer the charges, which were most likely not known to him in advance.
He was of course not allowed the advantage of counsel, and he might or
might not be faced with his accusers. If he did not immediately confess or
satisfactorily explain the charges, he was put to the method known as the
interrogatory examination. This was an acknowledged feature of the civil
and canonical law, which in its extreme form was pursued by the church
especially but not exclusively in heresy trials. It was a method that was
creeping into secular practice, in the courts of king's bench and common
pleas, as early as the reign of Edward I.¹ Sometimes it was administered
out of court, by juries examining witnesses, and in one instance a prelimi-
nary examination, having been conducted by certain clergymen, was made
to serve instead of an indictment.2 In the reign of Edward II, a plaintiff
alleged that he had not been duly summoned; the summoners were then
haled to court and examined3 of one of them it is said that he was sworn and
examined by the justices.³ As it appears in the beginning, there is not the
slightest ground sor the current belief that the practice was instituted by
the chancellors, however much they made use of it at a later time. In the
hands of the council the interrogatory method can be observed in such
cases as Rex v. Geraeston (p. 30), The Examination os Gilbert Blount (p. 33),
Uqhtred v. M usqrave (p. 59), and others. As practically administered the
examinations were of several kinds or degi-ees, according to the nature of
the case and the advancement of the art of questioning.

(l) In civil cases, also in criminal cases of forgery, counterieiting and the
like, there was an examination consisting of an inspection of documents, a
comparison of records, a scrutiny of seals, coins, etc. In such matters the
clerks of the chancery were the acknowledged experts. Likewise persons
before the court were examined in order to ascertain whether they were
minors, deaf mutes, madmen or lepers.

(2) Then there was a mild form of interrogation, later known as ore
tenus, wherein' no oath or means of constraint was applied, which was
intended merely to elicit a confession or secure certain information. This
