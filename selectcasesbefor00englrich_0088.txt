lXXXiV CASES BEFORE THE KING'S COUNCIL

grave, a soldier and courtier who in 1350 was summoned to the house of
lords. He was, therefore, a person of influential station, apart from his
office. So also were the complainants, the father of Sir Thomas Ughtred
being a knight of the Garter and having from 1343 to 1364 sat in the house
of lords by summons. Sir John Hotham was a member of a distinguished
Yorkshire family, probably the great-nephew of John Hotham, bishop of
Ely, chancellor 1318-20, and son of Sir John Hotham, dubbed a knight of
the Bath in 1327.1 N icholas Hotham was presumably of kin to him! The
charges against the sheriff were malicious arrest, false imprisonment, an
endeavour to entrap the complainants into an attempt to abuse the forms
of law, and the extortion of money. The legal snare alleged to have been
laid for the plaintiffs was a suggestion that they should arrange for a
collusive indictment of themselves and secure an acquittal from a jury to
be packed by the sheriff. This charge was also the substance of a complaint
by Sir Simon de Heserton, member of parliament for the county‚ and one
William Craunsewyk‚ about whom nothing is known. Taken together these
complaints3 are a serious attack on the judicial powers then generally
exercised by the sheriffs in their respective counties.

Now the sheriff's tourn, or circuit through the hundreds of the county‚
took place twice a year. In the twelfth century the sheriffs were apparently
endeavouring to enlarge their jurisdiction, for the Assize of Clarendon in
1166 directs that persons charged before them with murder or robbery,
and their accessories‚ should be sent before the king‘s justices for trial, and
the Assize of Northampton in 1176 extends this provision to thieves (ἒ 7).
Finally, Magna Carta (c. 24) lays down that no sheriff is to hold pleas of
the crown. From this date, the sheriff's tourn was held, not to try prison-
ers, but to take indictments against thern, like the inquest, still surviving,
held before the coroner, on which a man can be put on his trial. But the
sheriffs seem to have been ingenious in the invention of abuses of power.
The Statute of Westminster the Second in 1285‚4 recites extortions by them
from persons falsely charged with having been indicted in their tourns, to
check which indictments were ordered to be scaled by a jury, and to be kept
in duplicate, one copy by the jury indicting.⁵ Nevertheless, in 1314, the
commons os Suffolk were petitioning the king and his council for redress
against false indictments preferred by subordinate officials at court leets
and at sheriffs' tourns “de fere avantage a leur Mestres.’' ⁵ The complain-
ants were referred to the chancery3 but in the following year, at the
Parliament of Lincoln, a serious effort was made to check the evil by re-
quiring that the sheriffs, and also their subordinates‚ the hundredors, should
