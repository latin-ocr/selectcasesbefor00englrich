of great. power, moved with unsatiable
covetousness, to the danger of all ladies
and other women sole having lands, etc„
will take them by force or otherwise get
them into possession, and then will not

tion calling such persons to appear before
the chancellor or before the iustices of
assize, who having examined into the
matter might annul all obligations in·
curred in this manner and inflict penalty
