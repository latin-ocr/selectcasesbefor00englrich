lii CAsEs BEFORE THE K1Nc’s couNCIL

people were asked to make any complaints that they might have against
the conduct of the king's officers. In the trials of that day, involving many
judges and other ministers, only one officer of the exchequer was accused.
The present petitions on the contrary bear wholly upon the conduct of the
treasurer and the administration of the exchequer. Although we are not
told, it is probable that on this occasion the citizens were invited to make
their complaints, and that an intimation was given that their petitions
would be heard. With reference to the trials just mentioned a proclama-
tion to this effect had been issued in 1289? and again in 1307 Edward ΙΙ
encouraged the people to make their complaints against the deposed
treasurer Walter of Langton,⁴¹ directing that their petitions should be put
into writing and delivered to a clcrk especially deputed to receive thern.
Some such method, we can see, was followed in the compilation of the
present record, which consists of as many as fourteen separate bills that
have been brought together and transcribed by one or two clerks in a
single roll. The work was not quite finished, for according to the clerks’
note at the end one of the bills is lacking, and elsewhere in the parchment
spaces have been left unfilled. There is still another petition of complaint
against the ex-treasurer, which found its way into the Rolls of Parliament.⁵
The engrossment of the petitions leaves no doubt that there was an in-
tention of giving them formal consideration, but any hopes that may have
been raised of a new series of state trials were doomed to disappointment.
Whether because more urgent business took up the attention of the council,
or because a reform in the methods of the exchequer was not desired, the
petitions of the citizens were never given an answer. We should like to
have had judgments upon the charges, but even as they stand they are
not lacking in value for voicing the prevailing opinion of the Loncloners,
especially when the abuses mentioned are corroborated from other sources

As to the complaints in particular, the first charge of the citizens is that
they had been in certain cases impleaded outside the walls of the city, con-
trary to one of their best established liberties. This was a right that even
under a suspension of the charters they were still recognized as holding.
By the letters of his appointment the warden had been commanded ‘¹ to
guard and govern the citizens according to their customs and liberties.''
This duty, as the citizens themselves acknowledge, the warden performed
in challenging the act of the treasurer who was alleged to have impleaded
Osborn 16 Leuer for his free tenement outside the city. There are many
evidences that the government took particular care not to offend the
citizens on this point. Now the allegation of Osborn le Leuer that he was
thus impleaded is open to doubt in the light of a record of this same plea
in the Letter-books.⁶ It there appears that in 1292 Osborn was the plain-
