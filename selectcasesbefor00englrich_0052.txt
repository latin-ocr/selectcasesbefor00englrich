xlviii CAsns BEFORE THE K1NG⁷s 00011011,

Further, homage involved a presumption that the tenure was by knight
service ³ and the sympathies of the holder of land would naturally rank
themselves with the extent of his territorial interest. In England‚ at least
in this case, it only extended to their ploughlands.⁴ We may infer, therefore,
that Roger elected as his place of abode the scene of his social importance.
Moreover, ‘¹ one becomes a lord's subject by doing homage to him, and
this done, the nationality of one's ancestors and the place of one's birth
are insignificantfi ⁵

At a time when powerful persons held land both in Normandy and
England it was impossible to assert a principle of an exclusive nationality
determined by place of birth. As a matter of theory in England, Nor-
mandy‚ though step by step occupied by the French forces, remained
under the allegiance of King Henry. As a matter of fact, the power which
proved strong enough to compel the Anglo-Norman landowner on the
other side of thc Channel to feudal obedience exercised a legal as well as
a practical pressure upon him. Nevertheless, his services were due in
respect of his land in England to his feudal lorcl there, and Bracton and
Britton have no hesitation in prescribing the course of conduct incumbent
upon him. His persona] services are due to the superior lord ⁶ to whom
he has sworn allegiance⁷ by homage. ‘⁴ For allegiance is of so high a
nature, that if two lords are at difference, the tenant must perform his
service to his liege lord against his other lord in his own person, and must
perform his service to his other lord by attorney. And homage is so strong
a bond between lord and tenant that none may without judgment or the
mutual consent of the parties recede fron] the homage so long as the tenant
shall keep in his hands the tenements or fees for which he is bound to per-
form such service.'' ⁸ The ideal landholder, therefore, while he himself
will appear with his Norman retainers in the French camp, will have taken
steps to insure the presence of the English contingent due from him in
respect of his English land in the opposing army. Bracton quotes two
instances of eminent personages who acted upon this principle during the
sixty years' struggle for N ormandy.⁹

It is not likely, human nature being what it is, that respect for these
feudal contentions restrained lords or heirs in England from laying hands
on the land of those serving with the king's enemies abroad. Bracton gives
by way of illustration of the use of exceptions an imaginary case on all
fours with that in our text. “ 1f,” he says, ‘⁴ a man living in obedience
to the king of France claims land against you, you may except against
