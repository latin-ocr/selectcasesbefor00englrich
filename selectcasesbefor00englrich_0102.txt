xcviii CAsEs BEFORE THE KING’s COUNCIL

They complain that whereas by charter a fair and peaceable election is to
be held on the day of St. Edward the Κ1118,6 the mayor, John of North-
ampton, was in 1383 forcibly ousted from office by Brembre. It may be
noted parenthetically that John of Northampton had been alderman of
Cordwainer Ward.⁷ Brembre's eviction of the mayor had been followed

by the beheading of a cordwainer alderman, John Costantyn, and the -

imprisonment of divers of the brotherhood. After this the forcible election
of Brembre took place, as complained of by the grocers. A reign of terror
is described as having followed, Brembre's opponents being indicted on
trumped up charges of felony.

The petition here printed adds a new charge against Brembre. He had,
presumably upon the ground that as mayor he enjoyed a supervisory
jurisdiction, seized the chartei· of the Taylors and Linen Armourers, now
known as the Merchant Taylors' Company. The incident has escaped the
research of the historian of the company, the late Mr. C. M. Clode, and
it may be inferred that no record of it sui-vives amongst the company's
muniments. The year 1386, to which this petition belongs, was the last of
Brembre's political supremaey in the city of London. On 14 Nov., 1387,
113 was charged with treason by the Lords Appellant, impeached on the
17 February following, and shortly afterwards executed at Tyburn.

PETITION OF THE HANSARDS

The Petition os the H ansards presents a single stage of a prolonged liti-
gation, which may be taken as typical of many that vexed the relations of
England and the “ Easterlings.'' Since 1371, there had been a continuous
struggle over the trading privileges of the Hanse, against whom great
animosity was aroused. In response to popular clamour Richard ΙΙ had
suspended their charter in 1378, but restored it in 1380.l Yet the causes of
friction remained. Among the complaints of the English was the perennial
grievance that foreigners were carrying money instead of merchandise out
of the country; that they were keeping inns of their own apart from the
free hostelries of the city; that English merchants were received in Hanse
towns less favourably than the Hansards in England; that Englishmen
and their ships were being arrested and detained in a manner calling for
reprisalsf' At least, it was urged, the Easterlings residing here should be
required to give security that Englishmen would be treated as peaceably
and reasonably in their countries, as they were received and treated in
England. Α further grievance that these and other foreigners were en-
gaging in an unfair competition with native traders in the sale of herring
lies behind the present petition.
