IXXlV CASES BEFORE THE KING'S COUNCIL

BURTON—ON—TRENT v. MEYNELL

The petition of Burton·on-Trent v. M eynell is a complaint against an
aggressive knight of the county who has been committing deeds of violence
against the abbey. According to evidence derived from other sources the
abbot and convent had made an earlier complaint, which was answered by
the appointment of a commission of oyer and tenniner.1 The present com-
plaint repeats the charges and adds that because of the dire threats made
by their enemy, they dare not sue before the commission. They pray
therefore that the defendant may be brought before the king and council
to answer.

The petition points directly to a deficiency in the system of commissions
of oyer and terminer then extensively used. This was a method, begun by
Henry ΙΙΙ and elaborated by Edward 1‚2 that had long been the favorite
means of the council for dealing with criminal cases of exceptional diffi-
culty. Even when the council gave a preliminary hearing, it was likely at
one stage οι· another to refer the case, if not to one of the regular courtS,
then to a commission. The creation of general commissions, like those of
the justices of the peace in every county, did not diminish the number of
special commissions, which were granted by hundreds every year. The
system possessed manifest advantages, in that it relieved the council of an
excess of business; the commissions could be created to any number; they
might be composed of men especially suitable for the case in question; and
they could act with promptness in the immediate neighborhood where the
events occurred. The commissions were not altogether unpopular, for
many a petitioner asked for an oyer and terminer as an alternative to a
hearing before the king and council.³ There was a prevailing feeling, how-
ever, that the commissions were an irregularity in judicial procedure, and
that they were appointed too freely and to the detriment of the law. The
Statute of Westminster, 13 Edw. Ι, c. 29 granted that no such commissions
should be appointed except to regular justices, “unless it be for heinous
trespass,'’ and again the Statute 2 Edw. III laid down that writs of oyer
and terminer should be granted only ‘¹ for grievous and horrible trespass.'’
The Statute 20 Edw. III, c. 3, required that justices of oyer and terminer
should take a professional oath.

But the more the commissions were regulated‚ the more plainly do their
limitations appear, and the less are they able to deal with extreme con—
ditions. Following the procedure of the common law they were often
corrupted and defied in the same way as other courts. In 1354 there was
a flagrant instance of a session of commissioners in Lincohishire being
