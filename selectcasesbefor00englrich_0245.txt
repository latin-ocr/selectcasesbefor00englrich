Lowss'ror‘r v. YARMOUTH 61

in case that the said bailiffs and burgesses sue to have a charter that all the
ships ought to come to Yarmouth against the wish of the mariners, and
that against reason and good saith and against the common profit.

Also whereas in the time of the King Edward grandfather of our lord
the king that now is, in full parliament the twenty-eighth year of his reign,
it was ordained by statute for profit of the king and commons of the realm
that no manner of ship fraught towards England or elsewhere be compelled
to come to any port of England nor to remain against the will of the masters
and mariners of such ships, or of the merchants whose the goods be, the
which statutess was never repealed, and in case that the said bailiffs and
burgesses sue to have a charter that all manner of ships charged with mer-
chandises and herring and that enter into Kirkley Road, which is six
leagues ⁹ from the said town of Yarmouth, the which want to sell their
herring there, that they must come to the said town of Yarmouth, the said
suit is contrary to the said statute. The said commons of Lowestoft [are]
petitioners that no such charter be granted contrary to the said statute,
being the said statute in force.

Also as before this time the said bailiffs and burgesses of Yarmouth had
such a charter that all the ships entering Kirkley Road charged with mer-
chandise and herring that wished to sell their herring and merchandise
there must come to Yarmouth against the wish of the masters [and] mari-
ners, great damage and loss had they from this, because when the wind was
in the East, North, Northeast, or Northwest quarter no manner of ship
could enter into the said haven of Yarmouth, and for so much as that the
masters could not sell their merchandise to others at their will, the herrings
were spoilt and thrown at times into the sea by the mariners to the great
loss of the commons of England, by which mischief there has been great
dearness of herring when the said bailiffs and burgesses had [the] fran-
chises.¹⁰

Also because that the mariners are constrained so that they should not
be able to seli their herring in those ports to others than to those of Yar-
mouth and that at their will, because of which constraint all the alien
mariners take their herring to their own countries and thus there is great
dearness of herring in those ports for [the] abovesaid cause.

Also when the herring pass into private hands thus by constraint or
pretext of the king's charter the herring are the dearer because the said
private persons sell the herrings at their will..

Also whereas divers pedlars and carters of the counties of Cambridge,
Oxford, Huntington‚ Bedford, Buckingham, Northampton, Leicester‚
Essex, and Sussex were accustomed to come to the parts of Norfolk and
Suffolk at their will without coercion, and there to buy herring to victual
the said counties, the said counties are not now victualled by the said
pedlars and carters for the reason that the said pedlars and carters will not
be able to buy herrings save at the will of those of Yarmouth and for the
