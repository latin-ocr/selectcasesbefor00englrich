prejudice of the dignity of his church. By this inquisition indeed it was
found that no man was taken within his liberty but such an one as Thomas
was taken in the same place within the liberty of the lord William of
Valence. And 011 1110 Wednesday next following, at Ηο111011111’,19 1110 afore-
said 11151]ορ excommunicated William Goule bailiff of the aforesaid Lord
William and servant of the lord the king, which William indeed was not at
the taking of the robber aforesaid and likewise the same bishop excommuni-
cated William Messenger, Simon C 31101, Geoffrey Pese, and Thomas Hull,
who were present at the taking of that robber, because they were unwilling
to give the aforesaid prisoner up to him. And that sentence was promul-
gated by the bishop's own mouth. And on the Sunday next following he
likewise caused to be excommunicated the aforesaid William and the others
on the same ground in the parish church where they are parishioners, and
in four other neighbouring churches. And he passed that sentence by his
deans and chaplains. And on the eve of the assumption of the Blessed
Virgin Mary next following2⁰ 1110 aforesaid William Goule delivered to 1110
531110 111511ορ 1110 prohibition of the lord the king for which indeed he took no
care to do anything in that behalf. And on VVednesday next after the feast
of All Saints then next following²¹ the aforesaid bishop avowed and proved
by his proctors that they excommunicated the aforesaid William and the
others for the taking of the aforesaid robber before the Official of the
Court of C anterbury to whom the aforesaid William Goule appealed on ac-

cause of the aforesaid appeal, the aforesaid bishop carried to the aforesaid
official the king's prohibition,22 prohibiting him to proceed in the cause of
the appeal to the intent that his excommunication should be more bind-
ing,m by virtue of which prohibition the aforesaid official surceased until he
had a consulta‘tion24 from the king's court, and thereupon annulled the afore-
said sentence of the bishop; and the aforesaid bishop committed that con-
tempt against the lord the king by drawing 10 himself the king's jurisdiction
touching the taking and delivery of robbers where he ought to have shewn
to the king the fact aforesaid, contrary to his oath and allegiance to the
injury of the king’s dignity²⁵ (to the amount) of ten thousand marks²⁵ and
to the damage of the aforesaid William of Valence to that of two thousand
marks²⁷ and to the damage of the aforesaid William Goule to that of a
hundred pounds. And this he, Roger, is prepared to prove on behalf of the
lord the king &c. And the bishop comes and says that he wills not to
