same Robert produced still another letter of William himself in reply like-
wise written with his own hand and directed to the same John, wherein
among other things the following clauses occur: “ As touching the clerk,'’
etc. Then the same Robert produced a copy of a certain other letter written
in the name of the aforesaid John and directed to the same William, also
concerning the aforesaid rasure, wherein this clause among others occurs:
“ And also I preie you,'⁷ etc. As to this letter and clause the aforesaid
Robert Danvers produced a certain other letter of the said William in reply
written with his own hand, as has been stated, and directed to the aforesaid
John, wherein among other things the following clauses occur: “ And as
touching the old letter,'' etc. Hereupon the aforesaid Robert Danvers
asked that the aforesaid william be called to answer before the said council
for all the aforesaid copies, letters, and evidences alleged above against
him. And the said William then and there appeared in person, and having
viewed and understood for himself the aforesaid copies, letterS, and evi-
dences he affirmed and recognised that all such letters and clauses as are
alleged to have been written in the name of the aforesaid John Lydeyard
had come to his hands, and that he believing them to have been written
and sent by the aforesaid John had written the aforesaid responsory letters
and clauses with his own hand, as has been stated above. Moreover he
admitted that about St.. Katherine’s Day last he went with the aforesaid
Robert Poleyn to the aforesaid Tower, and that no one was at the time in
the room where the aforesaid records were kept, except themselves, two
only, just as the same Robert has already explained, and that the said
William then with his fingernail rased the number XL contained in the said
inquisition at the time of his visit, and with fresh ink wrote again the same
number, blotting it, in order that in this point especially it might appear
(a matter) for suspicion. Hereupon he was asked what number was first
found there in the aforesaid inquisition in the aforesaid place of the rasure
at the time of his visit. He said only the number XL, nothing greater or
smaller. He was asked at whose instigation he went to the aforesaid Tower
to make such rasure. He said at the instigation of the aforesaid John
Lydeyard. Hereupon the lord treasurer ²⁰ of England, who had laboured
