FOUQUIRE v. NICOLE 1

To the right reverend father in God, the most high, the most powerful
princae and honourable lords, My lords the Cardinal of England,² the Duke
of Gloucester ³ and other councillors of our lord the King ‘¹ in his realm of

England.

1432-36

pointed chancellor of the exchequer for
life in 1471 (ibid. 272), custodian for
Queen Margaret in 1475 (ibid. 571), treas-
urer of the town and marches of Calais
in 1483 (ibid. 373).

²⁶ Clerk of the couneil, jointly with
Thomas Kent in 1458, solely in 1462. See
Hevron v. Prome, p. 114, n.

¹ Found in Ancient Petamus, no.

² This was the title by which the kjng’s
uncle Henry Beaufort, bishop of winches-
ter, was commonly known. He had
accepted the cardinal's hat and a legatine
commission in 1429 without the king’s
consent, and for this he had to meet the
opposition of the duke of Gloucester and
others of his enemies, who contended that
115 had thus vacated his bishopric‚ made
himself liable to the penalties of Praemu-
nire, and even forfeited his right to sit in
the council. Hjs rights in these respects
were substantially vindicabed before par-

liament in 1431, although his politica]
influence was damaged (see Dici. Nat.
Bioq.). It is important for dating the
present petition to note that his name
appears with that of Gloucester in the
acts of the council during the years 1430—
31 and 1433-36 (Nicolas, Proceedinys, v,
35, 81, 174, 334).

³ The king’s uncle, Humphrey‚ duke of
Gloucester, who resigned the office of
protector in 1429, after which he was
made lieutenant and warden for two years
during the king’s absence. The lack of
any title and precedence given to the duke
in this petition indicates the date of the
present document as later than February,

⁴ The manner of the addi-ess indicates
the minority of Henry VI. Pet-itions to
the king himself begin to appear as early
as 23 Nov. 1436 (Nicolas, ν, 5), and from
that time his participation in the govern-
ment is evident.
