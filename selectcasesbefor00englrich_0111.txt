relations of England and Prussia. The first incident was when the new
king, immediately on hearing of his father’s death, was sailing from Bor-
deaux to England and overtook two Prussian hulks off the coast of Brittany.
The English sent men to board them and examine their charters‚ but the
strangers showed fight and delivered a regular attaek in which Englishmen
were killed. The Prussians, however, were captured and brought to South-
ampton as prizes before the court of adlniralty.² In the same year there
came before the council ambassadors from Prussia seeking a settlement of
their outstanding financial claims.³ They were told to put the matter in
writing and were given responsory letters to take back to the Grand Master.
When the Prussian ambassadors returned in 1415 they hardly gained a
hearing, and were put off by the chancellor from day to (lay with evasive
answers.4 At the same time the government made some effort to check the
depredations that were preventing a concentration of strength upon the
war with France. In one case twelve Englishmen were arrested for taking
part in a robbery of the goods of a Prussian, to be detained until they
should give satisfaction for their share of the 400 marks damages.5 The
statute of Henry IV was re'enacted that strangers in England shall be
treated in the same manner as denizens of England are treated in foreign
parts;⁶ this may be regarded as either a threat or a promise. Probably the
greatest grievance of the foreigners during these years was caused by the
king's seizure of a number of ships from Kampen, Dortrecht and a dozen
other foreign towns for his military necessities; the record of a promise of
payment to the owners was vacated, we are told, “because nothing was
done.'⁷ ⁷ Under these conditions it is not surprising to leam that English-
men like Hugh of Wythum suffered losses in Kampen and other towns.
We should like to know whether the claim of Hugh for a reprisal was
granted, but after the matter was given to a connnission of oyer and
terminer it is not heard of again.

DUVAL v. COUNTESS OF ARUNDEL

The complaint of William Duval a merchant of Rouen, that his cargo oi
wines had been confiscated by agents of the Countess of Arundel, illus-
trates a conflict of jurisdiction that was continually arising between the
central government and local lordships. It was naturally the interest of
local lords to seize storm-tossed vessels, calling them wreck, in spite of the
law laid down again and again that there was no wreck, if anyone, a man, a
dog or a cat, escaped alive out of the ship.¹ Likewise if a sailor fell out of a
ship and drowned, the lord of the place would claim the ship as deodand,
