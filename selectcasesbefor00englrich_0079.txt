broken up by a certain knight who invaded the hall where they were sitting,
and with drawn sword seized one of the justices by the throat, and would
have killed him had others not prevented.⁴ In this case the knight was to
be arrested and brought before the council. Later cases in this volume,
like Acte Wode v. Clifford, show how the commissions might fail because
their juries were corrupted or because sheriffs and bailiffs were in league
with this or that powerful party. But more often the commissions are
spoken of as “ procured ’' or ‘¹ stolen,” that is appointed in the interests of
one party or another, possibly “ champertors '’ interested in the suits
brought before them.⁵ Among many complaints of this kind, there was
one of the parson of Southampton, 5 Richard ΙΙ, who alleges that the prior
of Huntingdon has obtained a commission of oyer and terminer, and has
thus gained an unjust award of 390 against the parson. He therefore prays
that the matter may be examined by the good men of the reahn in the
present parliament and particularly that no oyer and terminer be granted.⁵
One of the worst abuses in connection wit-h the commissions was revealed
in the parliament of 1364—65, when the commons alleged that the king had
appointed commissioners of oyer and terminer for life, granting thern a

third of the fines and amercements of their sessions, so that they were dis-
posed to procure as many indictments as possible for the sake of the profits.
The king consented to abolish all such commissions and to appoint only
suitable men in the future.⁷

Now the prayer of the abbot of Burton that his case might be heard by
the council was not granted. Instead, a strengthened commission of oyer
and terminer was all that was conceded.⁸ Sir Richard Stafford,⁹ an ex-
perienced commissioner in cases of the sort, and four of the most reputable
of the king's justices ¹⁰ apparently succeeded in terminating the conffict.
At least it is heard of no more. But the council could not refuse every
petition of the kind. In the first year of Richard ΙΙ it was conceded in
parliament that there might be cases “ against such high personages that
right could not be done elsewhere.'’ ¹¹ The council heard at length such
cases as Esturmy v. Courtenay (p. 77) and others that follow. In answering

earl (Dice. Nat. Bioq) Not only did he
serve on a great number of commissions
in Stafl'ordshire, Oxfordshire, and Derby-

cui-ing indictments (Cal. Pet„ 26 Ed. III,

p. 366; 27 Ed. ΙΙΙ, p. 522), and in one case
convicted a man in ΞΙΟΟΟ (ibid, 31

pointed to another commission to deal
with a case of murder at Burton on Trent

iustice of the king's bench, 1361-65.
Nicholas Langford held the manor of

latter commissioner of the peace in Der-by-
shire.
