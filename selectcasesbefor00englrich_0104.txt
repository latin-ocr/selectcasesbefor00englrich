C CASES BEFORE THE KING⁵S COUNCIL

wrote a humble and coneiliatory letter to the magistrates of Lubeck, re-
citing the facts of the ease and promising restitution of the 5105 in accord-
ance with the judgment of the council.⁵ Meanwhile, Fynk and Heynson,
on charges not known to us, had been arrested and involved in processes
before the admiral. In the spirit of conciliation, these processes were
suspended and the men released. Whether there was any further litiga-
tion on the money and goods in dispute we are not informed.

The claims were not dropped, however, but after years of suspense were
taken up through diplomatic channels. After an aceumulation of grievanees
on both sides it was seen at length, in the reign of Henry IV, that a settle-
ment must be reached if the profitable trade of those regions was not to
be totally destroyed. Envoys were sent from England to Almain, and
from Almain to England, and articles of complaint were formulated on
both sides. Among the articles drawn up by the council of Lubeek in 1405,
and delivered to the English ambassadors, was the statement of claims
arising out of the ease of the Hansards in 1389.6 It is worth quoting in full:

Also in the year of our Lord, 1389, about the feast of the Purifica-
tion, men of Plymouth seized before Southampton a ship of Nicholas
Timmermann, loaded with 48 (sic) lasts of herring, each worth six
English pounds at the time, and they sold the said lasts in Weymouth,
and having sold them returned only the ship with its equipment to
the aforesaid Nicholas Timmermann. Moreover, the said lasts of
herring belonged to Conrad Vink, Gherard Glamhek, and Gherard
Buwman, citizens of Lubeck, and Werner Heynours, citizen of Dor-
treeht of the duchy of Gueldres, who were then and are still despoiled
of the aforesaid goods.

To this article the English ambassadors in their answers made no reply,
and the authorities of Lubeek returned to it in their replication.

Also as to the twentieth article no answer has been given by the
ambassadors of England. Wherefore the representatives of Lubeck
ask for a clearer statement.

To this the English replied,
It is necessary that articles be prepared specifying names and cog-
nomens, that speedy justice may be done to the complainants.

After this evasion of the issue nothing more could be done with the ease.
In the settlement of outstanding claims made with the Eastlanders in
1410, the English agreed to pay the Prussians ‚810‚000, but to the Hansers
they gave next to nothing.⁷
