this royall priviledge is not only appro-
priated to the palace of Westminster, but

⁹ The earliest papal bulls upon which
were founded the claims of the Abbey of

Westminster to exemption from episcopal
jurisdiction dated from John XV (986—
999) but were forgeries 01 3 later period.
Nevertheless, in 1222, 3 controversy on
this subject which had 3115011 with Eustace,
bishop of London, was decided in favour
of the Abbey by Cardinal Stephen Lang-
ton. 11 15 0011005 that the draughtsman
did not mention the charter of Edward the
confessor 01 1045, which “ specially
guards against episcopal 1111105100,Π 101
though it also is apocryphal, it is probably
as ancient as the twelfth century. See
preface to John Flete’s History os Wese-
minsler Abbey, edited by J. A. Robinson
(1909), pp. 14—17.

¹⁰ The day before the dissolution: see
n. 7, supra.

common form. Rymer's Foedera shew
that Edward II was at Westminster on 10
March, 1315. Hardy¹s Syllabas, i, 185.

to all the king's palaces, where his royall
person resides: Secondly, that this privi-
ledge is to be exempted from all ecclesias-
ticall jurisdiction.'' (3 Inst. p. [141].)

off till ¹¹ ιῘοὴαηηανη.”

appropriate to the Priory of Eye (Dug-
dale, Monast. [ed. 18461, iii, 409). Ι 113νο
not found any distinct mention of a
chapel, but there was a “Gild 01 St.
Thomas the Martyr Π here, which not
improbably had a chapel either within or
outside the parish church. lOth Rep.

¹⁴ Joan of Bar, only daughter of Henry
ΙΙΙ, Count 01 Bar, by the lady Eleanor
plantagenet, first daughter 01 Edward I.
She was, therefore, niece of Edward II. She
married on 20 May, 1306, John de War-
enne, known indifferently as Earl Waoenne,
Earl of Surrey and Earl of Sussex, he
being then aged twenty years. As Joan
de Bar must have been born between
1293, the year of her mother‘s marriage,
