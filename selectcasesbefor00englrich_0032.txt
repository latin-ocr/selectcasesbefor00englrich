ship and alliance with foreign states, e. g. Cosselcl v. Leveys (p. 32), Rex v.
Rouceby (p. 37), Lombards v. Mercers (p. 42), etc. So that the king and
council were never willing to lose control over these affairs by delegating
them entirely to lesser courts. There was therefore coming to the council
an unending stream of petitions complaining of seizures at sea, piracies,
violation of treaties, spoil of wreck, etc. The council indeed rarely heard
the cases, but endorsed the petitions, sometimes with a word of instruction,
referring the complaint either to a court of common law, or the chancery,
or creating a special commission for its determination. One of the earliest
cases os this kind was a suit of certain merchants of Spain and Portugal
heard in 1293 before a eommittee appointed by the king and council.¹ Our
case of Rex v. Rouceby (p. 37) was heard by the council in 1354, just a few
years before the beginning of the court of admiralty.

The need of a special court to relieve the council and the chancery of a
share of this business is sufficiently obvious. Out of a custom of employing
the admirals for judicial enquiries, as Mr. Marsden has shown,² from 1357
on they were granted extensive powers of jurisdiction, both civil and crimi-
nal, in cases arising upon the sea. In the rapid expansion of their authority
there is evidence of an intention at the time to create a court of strong
competence, like the court of chancery which was being enlarged at the
same time. But there were lirnitations upon the admirals and defects in
their courts that made their success in judicial functions far less than that
of the chancellors. As a result of complaints in parliament against their
usurpations and novel procedure, the Statutes of Richard II and Henry IV
limited the admirals' jurisdiction strictly to maritime cases; they were
given no power over inland waters, in the bodies of counties or within the
liberties of the Cinque Ports.³ Moreover there were grave abuses in the
courts of adniiralty as customarily conducted. There being two or three
admirals at a time, of the north, east, and west, each of them held his juris-
diction separately from the others. Being more concerned with their naval
duties, the admirals failed to give their courts the prestige of their personal
attendance, leaving the work mainly in the hands of a deputy or sub-
admiral. The courts were moved from place to place, to the great incon-
venience of suitors. The sessions could be held only in ports, never in
inland towns. Worse than this, the admirals permitted their courts to be
obstructed by a dilatory procedure, by which technical forms were multi-
plied and litigation prolonged indefinitely. One case arising in the 13th
year of Richard II was carried on for more than two years, in which as
many as eleven sittings can be counted, at three different places, listening
to bill, answer, replication, duplication‚ triplication‚ quadruplication,
attestation of witnesses, and at the last stage it was found that the court
