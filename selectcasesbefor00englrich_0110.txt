CVi CASES BEFORE THE KING’S COUNCIL

quickly passed over, and the award given unreservedly in favour of the
complainants. The lands in question were to be fully restored, and all
enfeoffments and transactions affecting the lands made since the ejectment
of John Atwood were to be annulled. To ascertain the amount of goods
carried off and the damage done, a commission of inquiry was appointed to
report at a later day, when the parties were to appear again before the
council.

As often happened, the award of the council was good in itself, but
deficient in execution. Part of the lands in question, we know, were
restored to John Atwood and his wife.⁴² But further restorations were
checked by J ames Clifford, who caused Atwood to be murdered in February,
1405, by a hired assassin.5 Anselm Guise was also implicated, and the
goods of both men were declared forfeited for their not appearing to
answer. Clifford was afterwards convicted of the crime in the king's bench,
and amerced in EIOOO. But before the end of the next year, in return for
his payment of 200 marks, the king pardoned him of all outlawries and
debts.⁶ At this price Clifford could afford to continue his depredations.⁷
How far the heirs of John Atwood ultimately recovered their lands and
goods has not been ascertained.

WYTHUM υ. ΜΕΝ OF KAMPEN

1418 The petition of H uqh de Wylhum υ. M en os Kampen illustrates another
stage of the perennial problem of indemnities and reprisals. In the treaty
made with the Grand Master of the Teutonic Knights in 1410 an attempt
had been made to mitigate the evils of reprisals by an agreement, that no
subject of the king should be arrested by the Grand Master by reason of
injuries committed upon his subjects by Englishmen, and similarly that no
subject of the Grand Master should be arrested in England for any such
cause. If injuries should be committed, it was agreed that the king or the
Grand Master, as the case might be, would give satisfaction3 but, if claims
should be made, and if after the lapse of six months all satisfaction should
be refused, it was allowed that a proportional amount of goods might be
taken from the property of Englishmen or Teutons, according to the cir-
cumstanceS.l Thus the customary law of reprisals was hardly altered.
To settle outstanding claims the sum of 10,000 marks was to be paid by the
King of England to the Grand Master as an indemnity. Two-thirds of this
sum remained unpaid when Henry V came to the throne, and immediately
there were claims and counterclaims for captures at sea to trouble the
