UGHTRED AND o'rHERs v. MUSGRAVE 58

power by whom such robberies and affrays were made and thereupon,
though he knew nothing of it, comes a letter of the king demanding, upon
penalty of as much as he had to forfeit, that he should make arrest and
execution of those who committed such robberies and affrays or otherwise
he would be held as a maintainer of the said robbers and malefactors. And
because there was common scandal and outcry that those who are now
complaining were under the scandal of the said deeds, the said sheriff
arrested them, since which arrest no affrays nor robberies have been com-
mitted in [those parts]. And the surety that he took os the parties attached
was not for the purpose of taking profit to himself, but that they might be
ready to be [before] the king and his council in case they should be com-
manded, as can be proved by their defeasance [clause].²⁶

Also as to the delay surmised against him as having been made so that
the king’s justices could not go to their deliverance, it was not in his power
to delay those who are his superiors to whom it is fitting that he should be
obedient, and if it please the council‚ they will be able [to examine] the said
justices, whether he caused the delay [alleged]‚ or not.

Also to that which is said that he had, as was alleged, counselled the said
master Thomas and master John that they ought to have caused themselves
to be indicted by their friends and that he wished them to cause an inquest
to be held for their acquittal — which thing ought not to be listened to,
because he was not of their counsel—but he said that in case that they
should not have been culpable, it would be better worth their while to be
clearly acquitted than to remain always suspected of such misdemeanours,
without counselling them to be indicted or promising their deliverance.

Also of the charge that he had caused the arrest of Robert Walman,
servant of the said Master Thomas Ughtred, and had held him in stronghold
by compulsion to cause him to summon his master, the cause of his taking
him was that one Walter Cotes was robbed at night of the sum above men-
tioned near the dwelling of the said Robert, and there was a common cry
and it was also said that he had information of the malefactors and that he
was even party to the robbery, so he was taken on suspicion till inquiry
about him could be made, and was afterwards indicted of the same robbery,
without that that ²⁷ he imprisoned him to make him [falsely] appeal the said
master Thomas or any other, and without that that he took any penny of
the said Robert as is suggested by their bill.

Also as to the taking of a hundred shillings of the said master Thomas to
be of help to him in an assize which master Thomas G(ray) brought against
him, and he (the sheriff) was opposed to him, to that he says that he, master
Thomas, had no such promise nor covenant from him but [a master] William
Acelom,2⁸ coming to him on the part of the said master Thomas Ughtred,
