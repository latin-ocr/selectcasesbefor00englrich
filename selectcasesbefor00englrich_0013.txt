PREFACE

ΤΗΕ death of Mr. Leadam in the Fall of 1913 in the full vigour of his
work was a serious loss to the Selden Society. With eminent success
as an author and editor, he had contributed three of the former pub-
lications of the Society, and was already engaged upon the present
volume, when the pen dropped from his hand. As his literary
executor it is incumbent upon me to explain the part of the labour
for which he is to be credited. Eight of the selected cases and
excerpts, including Boistard v. Cumbuvell, Taylor v. Rochester, Bz'shop
os Valenoe v. W orcester, Rea: v. Geraeston, Lombards v. Mercers,
M olyns v. Fiennes, Lowestost v. Yarmouth, and Taylors v. Brcmbre
were left in completed form with texts, translations, footnotes, and
introductions. These have been retained with the least possible
alteration. In Uqhtred v. M usqrave I have extended the text, and
further elaborated the notes. A mass of miscellaneous papers also
were placed in my hands. But the selection and annotation of all
the other cases are substantially my own. Because the work covers
much of the same ground, for the history of the subject Ι must
frequently refer the reader to my former treatise of The Kiny's
Councz'l (1913). As with almost every other enterprise in our affili-
ated countries, the world war has had its effect of cutting off com—
munications and delaying the completion of the work. At this
distance from the manuscript sources, Mr. Charles Johnson of the
Public Record Office has been my constant ally. He has read all
the proofs, corrected many a doubtful passage, and out of his expert
knowledge contributed materially to the notes. Finally, under
existing difficulties of transportation, the Harvard University
Press with hearty cooperation has solved the problem of publi-
cation on this side of the Atlantic.
