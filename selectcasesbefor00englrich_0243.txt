suspected or arraigned. And since the council is of the opinion . . . [that]
the aforesaid Thomas Musgrave has not alleged any particular act against
the aforesaid Thomas Ughtred‚ John and Nieholas, or that they have been
suspected of anything . . . and since they have not been indicted, but only
common cry and scandal [has been raised] against them, very likely since
by an inquest in the [aforesaid] county-before the justices or the sheriff this
could not . . . that [no] arrest in this case can be justified by the law of the
land, it is [forbidden] to the aforesaid Thomas Musgrave to [depart] from
town until the lord the king shall have pronounced his will in that behalf.
And the aforesaid parties were told that as they wished [to sue] the afore-
said Thomas Musgrave for losses in this . . . they should sue in the ex-
chequer of the lord the king . . . or in the king's court appointed for such
causes, if they shall see [fit}.

LOWESTOFT v. YARMOUTH¹

A PETITION or Lownsror‘r

These are the arguments stated by the people of Lowestost, poor ten-
ants of our lord the king,² [to prove] that the bailiffs ³ and burgesses of
Yarmouth ought not to have a charter of franchises touching the herrings
in the fair of Kirkley Road.⁴

Also that as in the time of the King Edward, the grandfather of our
lord the king that now is,⁵ it was ordained in parliament by statute ⁶ that
every subject of the realm should be able to buy and sel] all merchandises
and vietuals without impeachment within cities, boroughs, seaports, and
elsewhere, and if charters of franchises or usages or patents should have
been granted to the contrary, they should be held for null, and the suit
that the said bailiffs and burgesses are now bringing to have a charter
contrary to the said statute is not reasonable and [is] against the said
statute.

Also before this time by good deliberation of all the lords and eommons
in full parliament their charter was repealed for profit of the king and com-
mons of the land as was then shewn and proved in the said parliament.⁷

Also whereas by gift of God the ships which take herring put in at
Kirkley Road near the said town of Lowestoft and that which has been
taken at sea the merchants and mariners of the said ships in reason and
good faith ought to sell [and] to land their merchandise at their will, and
