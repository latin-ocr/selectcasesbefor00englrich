xlvi CAsns BEFORE THE KlNG's COUNCIL

upon men of rank may be found in parliament, but before the council they
were rare. However much they were threatened,¹ there was hardly another
instance, prior to the Tudors, in which a knight or a lord was punished in
any degree proportional to his offence. In the cases of great feuds, the
council was inclined to bring the parties, if possible, to an accord, e. g.
Neville v. N eville (p. 101). It manifested great faith in oaths and bonds as
surety for good conduct. Most of all the couneil under the Lancastrians
was in the control of lords and knights, who were themselves too far in-
volved in the practices of livery and maintenance to take any vigorous
measures against them. Under the Yorkists some of the worst known cases
of violence and oppression occurred, yet the council was feeble in dealing
with them. Political partisanship was sometimes involved. In Poche v.
I dle (p. 116) the last stage of impotence and disruption seems to have been
reached, when the best hope of the complainant is that one great lord may
be set against another in her defence. Thus far statutory authority was
lacking, which was not clearly granted until the Act 3 Hen. VII, among
other provisions strengthening the court, directed the council ‘¹ to punish
such as they find defective.''
