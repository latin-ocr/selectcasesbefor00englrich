REX v. WILLIAM MIDDLETON¹

Be it remembered that William of Middleton,² sheriff and escheator of
the lord the king in the counties of Norfolk and Suffolk, before the council
of the lord the king, in a chamber of the house of the friars preachers in
London‚³ where the king’s council is held, having been arraigned on the
charge that during the vacancy of the church of Denton 4 in the diocese of
Norwich‚ when the presentation of the same church (pertained) to the lord
the king himself by reason of the knights' fiefs and advowsons of the
churches which Eva, who was the wife of Robert of Tateshall ⁵ deceased,
held for life of the inheritance of the heirs of the aforesaid Robert, being in
the hand of the lord the king by the death of the aforesaid Eva, he peti-
tioned the lord the king to present to the same church the brother of the
wife of the said William, and when the aforesaid presentation was denied
him and when he had heard that the said lord the king had presented a
certain clerk of his to the same church, the same William went to Adam of

that the presentation of that church ought to pertain to the purparty of
Adam himself he obtained a certain presentation from the aforesaid Adam,
as if the partition of the aforesaid fiefs and advowsons had been made and
the advowson of the said church had been assigned to the same Adam as
his purparty, though they had not been; on the pretext of which presenta-

the aforesaid church and thus he obtained the same church,⁷ the possession
of which the said William afterwards asked the king to confirm ; and so the
same william falsely and against his oath ¹³ has sought the presentation of
the aforesaid church of the aforesaid Adam for the aforesaid brother of the
wife of the same William in order to exclude the lord the king himself from
his right to present the aforesaid church to a competent person, to the
deception and disinheritance of the same lord the king, etc.; he says that

left by Eva, to which the advowson of the
church of Denton belongs. The Cliftons
were greatly strengthened by these and
other acquisitions made by Adam, and

which occurred in 1350, these estates were
taken into the king's hand as oecheats of
an extinct barony (Cal. Inq. p. m. ii, 165).
They are yet to be partitioned among the
representativffl of three female heirs.

made a fortunate alliance by marrying
Margery Caini one of the heiis of the
Tatershall estates (Burke, Dormmzt and
Eztinct Peeraqes [1883], 124; also Blome-
field, viii, 350). This Adam now claims
his share in the partition of the estates

his son John in 1376 was summoned to
parliament as a baron. Their principal
estate was Freebridge Hundred (Cal. I ηρ.
p. m. ii, 246).

William of Ipswich‚ a proeentee ol* the
