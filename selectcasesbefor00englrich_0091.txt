but detaining them in jail‚²⁵ as Musgrave is accused of doing, and of charg-
ing them excessive fees.²⁶ These methods of oppression were, it is easy
to see, the outcome of the practice of receiving indictments. Whereas
indictments had, in the original contemplation of law, been bona fide pre-
sentments of facts by neighbours personally acquainted with them, and
concerned for the redress of the wrongs involved, the sheriffs had invented
a system of indictments preferred by creatures of their own, living at a
distance from the persons indicted and in no way cognizant of the subject-
matter presented. During the weak government of Henry VI these
malpractices increased‚2⁷ and they were the first mischiefs assailed by
Edward IV’s first parliament in 1461. The whole nefarious machinery of
oppression is ruthlessly laid bare by the preamble of this statute, which
illustrates the practices imputed to Musgrave in this case. “ Whereas many
of the king's faithful liege people, as well spiritual as temporal, by the in—
ordinate and infinite Indictments and Presentments, as well of F elony,
Trespass, and Offenses, as of other things, which of long time have been had
and used within the counties of this Realm, and taken before Sheriffs for the
Time being in the Counties severaHy, t-heir Under-Sheriffs, their Clerks,
Bailiffs, and Ministers, at their Tourns or Law Days holden before them
severally in the Counties, which Indictments and Presentments be often
times affirmed by J urors having no Conscience, nor any Freehold, and little
goods‚ and often by the servauntz menialx and Bailyffs of the said Shirrefs‚
and their Under-Sheriffs, by which Indictments and Presentments the said
lawful liege People be attached, arrested by their Bodies, and put in Prison
by the said Sheriffs, Under-Sheriffs, their Clerks, Bailiffs, and Ministers to
the great duresse of their Persones; and they so being in Prison, by the said
Sheriffs‚ Under-Sheriffs‚ their Clerks, Bailiffs, and their Ministers are con-
strained to make grievous Fines and Ransoms, and levy of them great
Fines and Amerciaments for the said Indictments and Presentments, in
great Hindrance and utter undoing of the said liege People; after which
Fines, Ransoms, and Amerciaments so made and levied by the said Sheriffs,
Under-Sheriffs, Clerks, Bailiffs, and their Ministers, the People aforesaid
be inlarged out of Prison‚ and the said Indictments and Presentments be
imbeziled and withdrawn.’' This time the axe was laid to the root of the
evil. The power of the sheriffs to arrest or fine any persons indicted at
their tourns was withdrawn. All indictments at the tourn were to be
transferred to the Justices of the Peace at the next sessions, who were em-
powered to award process against the offenders so i11dicted.²⁸ Stripped of
its power either to try or to accuse, the sheriff’s tourn became practically

obsolete.²⁹
