lxviii CAsns BEFORE THE K1NG¹s COUNCIL

fest citation.'’ His culpability was enhanced by his disobedience to the
inhibition issued by the archdeacon. He was therefore committed to the
Tower of London during the king's pleasure. The archdeaeon‚ as formally
responsible for proceedings in his name, was ordered to appear at the next

parliament, while instructions were issued to the sheriffs of London, York- '

shirc, and Lincolnshire to arrest the notary and witnesses guilty, with the
official, of contempt of court and produce them before the king on 25 June
following.

So far as this batch of papers is concerned, the case steps here, but other
records enable us to tracc its subsequent fortunes. The council could not
take upon itself to stay proceedings in a court christian. That was effected
by the inhibition of the diocesan, the bishop of Norwich. But though Ed-
ward II was not of a temper to overlook an invasion of his prerogative, he
entertained no objection to the divorce of his niece, with whose 111 relations
towards her husband he was acquainted. Three years previously he had
dispatched one of his yeomen to the earl's castle of Conisbrough in York-
shire to bring the countess to him at Windsor. The yeoman discharged his
mission, to the displeasure of some one highly placed and high-handed
enough to render it expedient for him to obtain a special patent of indem-
nity from the crown.⁷ The countess herself, under the protection of a body-
guard, was lodged in the Tower.⁸ It can scarcely be doubted that the
intimidator was the earl himself, who was frequently at variance with the
king. In 1316 the countess appears to have acquiesced in the earl's pro-
ceedings for divorce. There is enrolled in the Patent Roll for 24 February,
1316‚⁹ a license granted by the king at the request of John de Garenne (sic),
earl of Surrey‚ to bring his suit for a divorce against Dame Joan of Bar,
the king's nicee, in the court christian. A license was also granted ¹⁰ to
Matilda de Neirford, “upon withdrawing from her process of precontract
which she is bringing before Master Richard de Ryngestede, official of the
archdeacon of Norfolk,’' to cornmence proceedings against the earl and
countess touching such precontract “before Master Gilbert de Myddeltonss
and Master Williarn de Bray,¹² canons of the church of St. Paul, London,
