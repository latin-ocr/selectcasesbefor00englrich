xxxii msns BEFORE THE KING’S COUNCIL

known indeed to have existed in the curia regis of the thirteenth century,
and was afterwards operative in the various eourts of common law, in-
cluding those of the itinerant justices.¹ From the beginning the council
was broadly a court of equity, in that its action was a dispensation of the
royal prerogative; it received cases on petition, it showed merey and leni-
eney in the application of the law, it admitted suitors legally disabled, it
required speeific performanee in the restitution of goods and ehattels.²
There is a difference of opinion, however, whether the later equity, as
developed by the ehancellors, was a continuation of the earlier equity
administered by the common-law eourts, or whether we should regard the
chancellors' equity as “a new, a distinet, and an independent develop-
ment.'’ ³ Dr. Holdsworth places the two phases in contrast to one another,
while Professor Adams argues for the essential continuity of the principles
of equity in the curia regis, through the courts of common law and into the
court of cliance1·y.⁴ It iemains to shew how far the couneil gave expression
to the equitable principle, and what precedents it laid down for the court of
ehancery. In this enquiry special attention must be given to the cases of
verbal agreements, trusts and uses, which, says J ustiee Holmes, were “ the
greatest contribution to the substantive law ever set down to the credit of
the ebanem-yffi One of the most notable cases ant-edating the court of
chancery in its equitable funetions was that of Audeley v. Audeley heard in
1366ss In this instance a married woman without the concurrenee of her
husband, a semme sole having no standing at common law, was heard by
the eouncil in a suit against her father-in-law for the performance of a pre-
marital contract. After a sharp contest, interesting in several points of
procedure, there was an award requiring speeifie performanee of the terms
of the eovenants under pain of AEssooo. In the Fraunceys case heard in 1392
certain parties, who proved to be dishonest executors, were examined before
the council as to the existence of an obligation not produced in eourt.⁶ Of
trusteeship in goods and chattels there is the example of H oqonona v. A Friar
Austin (p. 85) in 1401, wherein the petitioner alleges the loss of money and
a breviary left in trust, and asks for a hearing before the couneil. But the
couneil, as it appears, merely ordered his release from captivity without
affording any further relief. In 1422 there was the full hearing of a ease,
Lanyesord v. Prior os Gisburn,⁷ in which the petitioner seeks the return of
certain jewels and other goods which the prior refuses to surrender. On
