counted in our case, the policy in regard to these appointments was com-
pletely changed. Taking the year 1362 35 311 experiment we find that
throughout thirty-four counties in which comparisons are possible, with
only two possible exceptions, the escheators were not the same men as the
sheriffs, nor does it appear that the earlier policy was ever restored. The
result is all the more significant when considered in connexion with other
steps that were taken toward the diminution of the functions of the sheriff.¹⁰

REX v. ROUCEBY AND AVENEL

The king's case against William Rouceby in 1354 is to be understood in
connexion with the policy of Edward III toward Genoa. This was to main-
tain at all costs friendly relations with the city in the midst of the war with
France, while the Genoese, like the Swiss in the military operations of a later
time, were inclined to lend their aid now to one side and now to the other.
At a heavy cost the king succeeded in negotiating treaty after treaty, by
which the city agreed to make no alliance with the king’s enemies.l In one
case, mentioned in 1338, he went so far as to compensate the owners of 3
(36110656 galley out of his own privy purse.² In the treaty of 1347 311 indem-
nity of AE10,000 for certain recent losses caused by English sailors was prom-
ised, and another indemnity of 8,000 marks for losses dating from the reign
of Edward 11.³ The method of paying these indemnities was the uncertain
one of remitting custom duties to an equivalent amount. To the same end
letters of protection and safe—conduct were liberally granted to Genoese
merchants, to come and go in all parts of the reahn, provided they did not
communicate with the 6116111Υ.4 But the work of diplomacy was being en-
dangered by the acts of privateers causing the Genoese to complain again
and the king to promise further indemnities. In 1353 the king specially
commanded his admirals to observe the protections that had been granted
to various shipmasters of Genoa.⁵ Under these circumstances the attack
made under the orders of John Avenel the king’s captain and lieutenant
of Brittany, as recounted in the present record, was peculiarly disconcert-
ing.

There had been previous complaints of the same kind against the captain
of Brittany, who was prone to seize vessels that were driven by storm or
were awaiting a favorable wind in the havens of the principality. On two
occasions Thomas Dagworth, a predecessor of John Avenel, was called to
answer for such seizures before the king's counci1.⁶ Of the outcome we
know nothing, except that Dagworth was soon afterwards followed by
another captain. The present case is remarkable for affording a complete
