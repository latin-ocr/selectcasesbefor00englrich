lxxxii CAsns BEFORE THE KING’s COUNcu,

confession, it may have been gratifying to their feelings to be able to fasten
the blame upon two persons shady of reputation and skilled in evading
the law. As for the abetter, Richard Phelip, his insignificance has defied
identification. From such a finding the complainants must have reapt but
meagre satisfaction.

PARSON OF LANGAR v. CONYNGSBY

The petition of the Parson os Lanqar v. Conynysby brings forward an
appeal on error in the court of chivalry. According to the allegations of
the parson the latter court had erred in two counts: first, that in a suit for
damages an award had been made in the absence of the defendant; secondly‚
that the court had no eognizance of such a plea. The appeal was compli-
cated by the circumstances of a detention under duress, and it was probably
this aspect of the ease rather than the fonner, that caused the council to
give it attention.

Now the jurisdiction of the court of chivalry, usually mentioned as the
court of the constable and marshal, was a (lebated question at this time.
In this and other complaints it is asserted that the court was extending its
jurisdiction from deeds of arins and war to pleas of various sort. We
should have liked a decision upon the question at this time, but the council,
being more coneerned with the release of the parson from imprisonrnent
and the future good conduct of his opponent, evaded that issue by bring-
ing the parties to an agreement. As to the authority of the court of
chivalry nothing further was done until the reign of Richard ΙΙ, when by
the Statute 8 Richard II, c. 5, it was laid down that pleas at common law
should not be discussed by the constable and marshal; and that their
court should have only what belonged to it. The intent of these enactments
was more clearly stated in the Statute 13 Richard II, c. 2, which limited the
court to cognizance of eontraets touching deeds of war outside the reahn,
and to things of arms and war within the realm which cannot be deter-
mined by conunon law. Whether under this statute the court had cog-
nizance of such a plea as that appealed by the parson of Langar, we are
still in doubt. But this doubt is cleared by the Statute 1 Hen. IV, c. 14,
that all appeals of things done within the realm were to be tried by common
law, and all appeals of things done outside the reahn were to be tried and
determined before the constable and marshal. Whether the parson’s
affair touched a deed of war or not, it certainly occurred outside the
realm.

Under the statutes appeals from the court of chivalry were invited and
made easy. The usual ground taken by a defendant, as in the present case,
was an exception to the jurisdiction of the court. In one such case it was
held that a defendant who submitted to the jurisdiction of the court of
chivalry could not withdraw, but if defeated, he might afterwards appeal
