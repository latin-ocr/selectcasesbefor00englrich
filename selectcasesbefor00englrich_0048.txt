xliv CASES BEFORE THE KING's COUNCIL

employed for such work. There was as yet no system of appointing com-
mittecs, much less were there any standing committees Under the elastic
organization of the eouncil it was not required that more than four be in
attendance for matters of minor concern; often there were but three. But
on occasion it was expressly given to “some of the council ’⁷ to make an
examination of the question in hand and report their findings. The com-
mittecs might be named by the king, but sometimes they were deputed by
the council itself. Once in considering the claims of alien prisoners the
council found itself too busy to go into the evidence, and so committed the
matter to a bishop and a layman for inspection and examination.¹ On
another occasion the eouneil agreed to act in aecor-(lance with the repert of
its com1nittee.2 In Legat v. IsVodeward (p. 92), a case pertaining to the
king⁷s revenues, the inquiry was given to the treasurer and barons os the
exchcquer, who returned the certification here given at length. In the
F raunccys case. two examiners went to a private house where the witness
lay sick.³ In imitation of the professional examiners employed by the
church, there were in the chancery certain clerks mentioned as regular
“exarnine1·s.'’4 No examiner however in the council appears before the
time of the Tudors. In spite of the fact that the interrogatories were anti-
pathetic to the common law, they were persistently given to judges to
administer whenever judicial questions were involved, until complaint was
made in parliament that they were thus being kept from their regular work
of hearing pleas.

One* other mode of delegation adopted by the council from the common
law was by writ of dedimus potestatem,⁵ whereby an examination or any
other function of the court might be performed at a distance. The com-
missioners were likely to be local men not otherwise connected with the
court. The method had its advantages but encouraged the evils peculial·
to affidavits. So far as the records shew it was sparingly used by the coun-
ci1,⁶ but cultivated extensively by the later court of chancery.

With all these agencies of assistance, in most cases all that remained was
a final hearing or “ rehearsal '’ of the matter before the couneil. Unless
there was need of deliberation, the trial was speedily brought to a conclu-
sion. Everything, so far as possible, was reduced to writing, and in the
longer cases an orderly record or engrossment was made of the entire pro-
ceedings. Points for debate were few and easily singled out. The coun-
cillors were finally asked for their opinions (sententiae), and on the most
formal occasions these were required of the lords individually. There was
no rule as yet in favour of beginning with the lowest rank. The judges,
when asked for their advice, gave it jointly. It was a rule repeatedly
