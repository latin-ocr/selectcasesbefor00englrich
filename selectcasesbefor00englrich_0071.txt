den, now known as Bracon Ash, near Norwich. It does not appear what
governed this choice of place, for the manor appears to have been in the
family of Peverel;⁵ so probably the archdeacon's church was here, where
he held his court.

Archdeacon Gerdeston filed a defence repudiating responsibility for the
citation. He knew nothing of the process, he alleged, until he received from
his diocesan, the bishop of Norwich, notice that the king had ordered the
bishop to transfer the case to himself. As this was a suit in an ecclesiastical
court, this must mean that the king procured a stet processus until the ques-
tion of violation of privilege had been decided before himself and the
council. Upon receipt of this notice, the archdeacon avers that he at once
inhibited his official from taking further steps. This inhibition the official
who appears to have been the Rural Dean of Cranwich, in Norfolk,⁶
acknowledges himself to have received and avers that in compliance with
it he abstained from any further intervention. The king's attorney, on the
other side, produced a record of the proceedings before the official which
had been transmitt-ed by the bishop of Norwich. Among these it was set
forth that the chaplain of Yaxley in the presence of a public notary, Robert
de Cockerton, acknowledged that on the 8 March, 1315, he had given
notice to Joan of Bar that she was cited to appear in the church of St.
Nicholas Brakeden as respondent in a suit for a divorce from her husband,
the Earl Warenne; that the countess not entering an appearance was pro-
nounced by the official to be in contumacy and citations ordered to be
posted up at the doors of certain churches and in certain manors; and that
by these she was again ordered to enter an appearance and file an answer
in Brakeden Church, the time being enlarged from 15 March to 12 April,
1315. Confronted with this document, the official pleaded by way of con-
fession and avoidance, that though he was responsible for what had taken
place, the record shewed that no citation had been served, but only notice
given that a citation had been issued elsewhere. F urther, the notification
was not made by him, but by a certain dean of the diocese of Norwich; and
any other proceedings to which he himself had been a party had been not
consequential to that notification, but independent of it and in accordance
with the forms of the law ecclesiastical. Inasmuch as the proceeding in the
crypt of St. Stephen‘s appears to have satisfied the canonical exigencies
roepectmg citations and to have justified, in the opinion of the accused
ecclesiastics, the consequent charge of contumacy, the official's refinement
was held unsubstantial. This conclusion was fortified by his inability to
produce any evidence of the more formal and attested citations to which
he had referred in his defence, so that he was estopped from pleading the
invalidity of his own procedure. In the words of the judgment, “ he con-
tinued his process upon the same notification as if it were a due and mani-
