CX CASES BEFORE THE KING’S COUNCIL

reason of an appeal made by the countess on the ground of error. Her peti-
tion in the parliament of 1430—31 was referred to the council, but the council
doubted its power. A second petition in 1433 directed the parties to go
before the council and definitely gave the council power to reverse the
judgment of the exchequer.4 The council did not welcome the task. From
20 January to 25 February, 1434, attorneys for the countess sought from
day to day to obtain a hearing, and at length were told that “ because of
arduous business affecting the king and the reahn '' the matter could not be
examined then, and that the parties might come again within three weeks
from the following Easter.⁵ Apparently there was another postponement,
before the council gave any attention to the matter. Then on 4 February,
1435, there was proposed the expedient of a board of arbitrators, of whom
each side should choose three lords and two justices; and if these should
not be able to end the matter, it should be reported back to the council.⁶
At this point an historian of the family is disposed to believe that the feud
took a wal-like turn and proceeded by methods of slaughter and destruc-
tion.⁷ But chronicles and documents as yet say nothing of the sort, and the
record before us mentions only ‘¹ fear of suits, unlawful entries and other
labours that were likely to be done.’' A further postponement of the strife
was effected by the incident disclosed in the present memorandum. When
the king in 1435 required the services of Salisbury and F auconberg in the
war, their mother the countess consented to their departure only on con-
dition that the earl of Westmoreland should give surety to forbear suits
and other proceedings during the specified time, as a. sort of moratorium
esscntially similar to the war moratoria of t-oday. This the earl was
induced to do and gave a recognizance of 54000. There was no breach of
the peace apparently during the absence of Salisbury and Fauconberg, nor
during the three years following. In 1438 the council took the matter in
hand again, endeavouring to bring the earl of Westmoreland and the
countess to an agreement.8 But the judicial fairness of the council was
manifestly open to question, since the earl of Salisbury had become an active
member of the council and had gained a marked politica] ascendency.⁹
Before the end of the year the inevitable outbreak occurred. According
to a signed letter of the king to his chancellor‚ dated 28 December, the
parties “each against the other by manner of war and insurrection have
late assembled great routs and companies upon the field and done further-
more great and horrible offences as well in slaughter and destruction of our
people as otherwise.’' ¹⁰ The king commands that all the parties be called
to answer as law and reason require. But one searches in vain for any
effective treatment of the matter at the hands of the council.
