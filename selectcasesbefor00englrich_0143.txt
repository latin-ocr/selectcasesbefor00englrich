crrlans or LONDON v. THE BISHOP or BATH 10

such as wines, eloth, bullq* commodities, wool and wool-fells and other
articles of merchandise, which usually come to the city in time of peace, but
do not come now because of the war ;13 but most pleas such as pleas of debt,
trespass, covenant, mort d’ancestor, novel disseisin, and partition of land
are lately, by bill and not by writ of the king, drawn into the exchequer, 12
before stewards and marshals,¹⁴ so that nothing remains in the city to award,
nor are they willing in (hearing) such pleas to allow the charters or the
challenges of the citizens in any way. But often they have before them
one or two hundred poor men of the city, labourers (serving) in juries, in
inquests, in assizes, by delays and by adjournments being kept for a week
or a fortnight‚ so that they lose their work and are wholly impoverished.¹⁵
And they show each year during this war that the two sheriffs¹⁶ are as
nothing for the payment of the sheriff’s ferm. For everything has been
withdrawn whereon the ferm might be levied. W'herefore they pray for
remedy.

And above all his citizens would beseech the king, if they dared, to save
them from such villainies and from the reproach of all rnen of cities and
towns, who have franchises which they have not, and if it pleases him to
grant them entire their franchised estate, just as they have been anciently
accustomed to have, for the better and the more strongly he maintains
them in conditions of welfare and honour, the more sufficient they will be
to these liege commandments, to which they are wholly devoted.

To our lord the king and his council Pier of Tadcastre shows that Master
William de la March bishop of Bath and Wells by his clerks, Hugh of
Nottingham¹⁷ and John of Kirkby,¹⁸ has wrongfully made him a prisoner in
irons in the Fleet prison for a year and a half, because of certain arrearages
in the account of Master Robert of Tadcastre his deceased brother,¹⁹
although Pier is neither his heir nor executor; nevertheless they have
seized and are in possession of all his goods and chatteIs, for certain arrear-
ages that they wrongfully demand of him. And a month after last Michael-
mas at the last parliament he purchased three writs of the king to the

the project met with such resistance that
the right of election was confirmed to the
citizens. Απη. Lond. 95, 102; Cal. Leuer-

¹⁸ Not to be confused with the treasurer
of the same name who died in 1290. This
John appears on the rolls as a clerk, jus-
tice of oyer and terminer and auditor of
accounts. In 1291 he was keeper οἰ the

rolls of the chancery, in 1301 king’s
remembrancer, in 1307 one of the commis-
sioners to audit the accounts of the Fres-
cobaldi, and in the same year custodian of
the plaints made against the late treasurer
Walter Langton. His death is mentioned
in 1309 in connection with the property
that he left. Madox, ch. xvi, θὴς Calen-

who was presented in 1292 to the church of
