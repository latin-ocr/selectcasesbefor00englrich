INTRODUCTION lxxxix

Henry de Percy, Roger de Clifford, william de Fyncheden, and William de
Wychyngham. The commission is one of Oyer and Terminer in the coun-
ties of York and Westmoreland, “ touching all felonies, trespasses, con-
spiracies‚ extortions, oppressions, falsities, grievances, and excesses,’' etc.
A commission issued at Westminster on 20 June could not well have been
executed in Yorkshire before July. It has been seen that there is some
ground to conjecture that before Ughtred appeared to these indictments
he had, in his case against the sheriff‚ already secured the judgment of
the council in his favour. It may well be supposed that he then and there
availed himself of this favourable tide of fortune. Musgrave was defeated
and in disgrace and Ughtred was probably armed with the king's pardon
before he went northwards to plead guilty to these indictments. It can
scarcely be doubted that the sheriff had cause to suspect a man, on his own
confession guilty of three highway robberies, of the other offences laid by
public scandal to his charge. The amazing thing is that Ughtred was in—
fluential enough, both in his own county and in London to extricate him-
self from charges which, if they were true, must have made him the terror
of the country-side, and which, even if they were false, still left him under
others which were true and scarcely less grave. It is difficult not to feel
some sympathy with the sheriff whose displacement from office, as has
been noted, dates from 13 May. Of the Hothams we hear no more.

LOW'ESTOFT v. YARMOUTH

1378-80 The counter-petitions of Lowestoft and Yarmouth are incidental to a
prolonged conflict of local interests, but are not without constitutional sig-
nificance. In consequence of the silting-up of the haven of Yarmouth,
which the townsmen in 1346 endeavoured to clear by cutting a new en-
trance, vessels had been compelled to take in and discharge their cargos in
Kirkley Road. This is described in an Inquisition ad quod damnum of
1370,¹ as “ a certain place in the sea, near the entrance of the haven of the
same town '’ (Yarmouth). It would appear, however, that the name ex-
tended southwards over an indeterminate area, as far even as a mile south
of Lowestoft, now known as Lowestoft South Roads, some ten miles distant.

The lading and discharge of vessels being carried on at such a distance
from Yarmouth facilitated the evasion of the customs duties out of which
the town maintained its fortifications and paid its dues to the crown. Upon
petition of the townsmen, therefore, Edward III granted a charter, dated
22 August, 46 Ed. III (1372), annexing Kirkley Road to Yarmouth. The
charter also prohibited the lading or discharge of cargo or of any herring,
or other merchandise, within seven ² leagues ³ of the town, unless the goods
