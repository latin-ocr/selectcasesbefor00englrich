REX v. WILLIAM MIDDLETON 36

tion of this kind, but he says that by virtue of a certain writ ⁹ of the lord the
king himself directed to the same William as escheator of the lord the king
in the aforesaid counties, for making the partition of the aforesaid fiefs and
advowsons between the said Adam and other parceners of the said inheri-
tance, he has made partition of the aforesaid fiefs and advowsons between
the aforesaid parceners, and according to the same partition the advowson
of the aforesaid church was assigned as the purparty of the aforesaid Adam,
which partition indeed he gave over to the attorneys of the aforesaid par-
ceners to be returned into the chancery of the said lord the king according
to the tenour of the aforesaid writ, and, the said church being vacant after
the aforesaid partition, the aforesaid Adam presented the brother of the
aforesaid William to that church; and because he had afterwards heard
that the aforesaid partition was not returned in the said chancery, and
since it would be of no validity until it was received in the same chanceiy,
fearing that on this account the said one presented by the aforesaid Adam
could be hindered in his admission to the aforesaid chuleh, he sent his
letters to Peter of Brewes ¹⁰ knight and John of Herling,¹¹ who were tarrying
with the said lord the king, that they might seek with the lord the king to
obtain from him a presentation of this kind, and after the admission of the
said one presented to that church the aforesaid William, who was himself
wholly ignorant of the presentation made by our said lord the king to the
same church petitioned that the estate of the one presented by the said
Adam be confirmed by the lord the king, and (he says that) he does not
know that in this he has done or attempted anything that can result con-
trary to his oath or to the disinheritance of the lord the king in this matter.
And since, after viewing the aforesaid certification of the aforesaid parti-
tion returned by the same William in the aforesaid chancery‚ there is not
contained in the same the day or the place when and where that partition
was made, and whereas the writ ¹² directed to the same William for making
the aforesaid partition is of the date lOth of February in the 26th year of
the reign of our said lord the king of England, the same writ with the cer-
tification then made was not returned before the Octaves of Holy Trinity¹³
in the 27th year of the reign of our said lord the king of England, by which
it seems clear that the aforesaid certification as well as all the other fore-
going things alleged by the aforesaid Williarn for his excuse in this matter
are delusory and not true. And so it was adjudged that the aforesaid cer-

offices he was permitted to discharge by
deputy because of his attendance upon
the king (Cal. Pal. 26 Ed. 111, 327, 348,
355, etc.). With all these honours, it is
curious that he should have required a
pardon for a burglary (ibid. 34 Ed. 111,
390). In 1360 he was constable of
Wisbech Castle and continued in active
service as usher and serjeant until he was
granted an exemption from public dutiae

in 1367 (ibid. 394). He was the virtual
founder of a strong family in Norfolk
which derived its name from Herlingfs
Manor left by John to his descendants
(Blomefieffl, i, 319).

¹² The writ, is recorded in the Close
Roll, but for the reasons here given is
marked as vacated. Cal. CI. 26 Ed. ΙΙΙ,
¹³ 26 May, 1353.
