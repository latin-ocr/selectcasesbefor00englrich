xviii CASEs BEFORE THE KING’s COUNCIL

solves to consult with the king and his sapicntiores.¹ So long as the fun-
damental unity of the courts was maintained, it was natural that the council
should bc. consulted whenever the justices were uncertain of their ground.
The cases of the thirtecnth century abound in references of this kind to the
council, which then appears not in the light of a higher or a distant tribunal,
but a largcr assemblage, often quickly summoned, of the existing court.
The greater distinctness of the courts, as effected in the fourteenth century,
hardly lessened the practice 0f the justices meeting in council for the pur-
poses of discussion.² The court of common pleas was once in a quandary over
its inability to put a judgment into execution. The justices were divided
in opinion, when the chief justice concluded, “ we have spoken to the coun-
cil respecting this mischief ; (to one of the litigants) go you to the chancery
and you will have a ‘non obstante writ directing us to effect execution.'’ ³
The council was not a court of appeals; the common-law comts themselves
denied its right to review their judgments on allegation of error. Yet some-
thing to the same effect was granted in its power to determine a point of
procedure. The Statute 13 Ric. ΙΙ, c. 2, lays down that if anyone complain
that a plca pending in the court of chivalry should be tried by common law,
he shall have a writ to surcease until it be discussed by the king's council
whether the matter ought to be tried in that court or by common law.

It is abundantly evident that the principal attention of the couneil, in
judicial matters, was given not to the hearing of cases at length, but to
facilitating their hearing by other courts. This was done to the best advan-
tage by answering the petitions that were presented in indefinite number.
There were petitions of grace, asking for favour, and petitions of right,
requiring judicial aetion, but in hearing them no separation was made of
the one class from the other. Every petition in fact was a request for a
measure of the king‘s grace. According to a well established custom, peti-
tions of law should be presented in parliament, wherein special committees
were appointed to receive and hear them, but parliament was unable to deal
with them all. In the time of Edward III it became a matter of urgency
that petitions should be heard before the close of the session, and it was
sometimes a grievance that they were not heard but left over “ from par-
liament to parliament,⁷' while petitioners must sue and sue again. Under
these conditions petitioners sought the council as an alternative. In the
Parson os Lcmyar v. Conynqsby (p. 48> we see a petitioner‚ who was forcibly
prevented from suing in time of parliament, turning then to the council for
relief. Parliament was jealous of this tendency. In the reign of Richard II
it distinguished between those petitions which could be considered only in
parliament and those which could be considered apart by the- couneil.⁴
