mitted in that city upon certain merchants of Lombardy with which he is
charged.'' The condition of the release is that his mainpernors undertake
to produce him “ before the king and his council at order to answer for the
premises.” The writ is signed, conformably to the king's answer of 1354,
by the chancellor. It would seem, therefore, that the city authorities were
themselves contemplating action and that, for some reason not easy to
guess, the accused preferred the tribunal of the council, probably by no
means reluctant to assert a jurisdiction in the matter. A month later,
1 December, 1357, a writ issued by the chancellor addressed to Robert
Morley‚ keeper of the Tower of London, or his deputy, ordered the release
on mainprise to appear before the council of “Thomas de Maldon, of
London, Mercer,'’ imprisoned for the same offences. The writ recites that
he had already been ‘¹ a long while detained.'’ ²⁰ Two months later an—
other writ from the chancellor ordered the constable of the Tower to re-
lease ‘¹ Nicholas de Sharpenham, mercer,” on the same terms.21 Lastly,
on 4th March, 1358, another writ issued from the chancellor to the sheriffs
of London, couched in phraseology similar to that in the case of Wroxha1n‚
ordering the release of Thomas Everard of London, mercer, from their
custody, upon the same terms as to appearance.22 In each of these cases
the names of the mainpernors were set out as in the document B here
published. That document, however, is, so far as it goes, a duplicate of the
Close Roll, being, as it is, a return to the writ of 8 July, 1359. It is ma-
terial to notice that in two of the above instances the 0000011 takes the
prisoners out of the city’s custody and itself assumes seisin of the case.
< In the case of Nicholas de Sharpenham, mentioned above, the Close
Roll suggests problems other than those affecting the rest of the defendants.
The Close Roll runs as follows: “To the Constable of the Tower of London,
or to him who supplies his place. Order to release Nicholas de Sharpen-
ham, mercer, from prison, by a mainprise, as the king ordered the constable
to certify why Nicholas was imprisoned in the Tower, and he who supplied
the Constable’s place returned that Nicholas was delivered to him by
Henry de Cove of London, mercer, and Richard Shakel, serjeant of London,
who told him to keep Nicholas safely until the King’s Council should send
for him to be brought before the Council, and that he had no other cause or
warrant.’⁷ There follow the names of the mainpernors, as in the text of C,
who “ have mainperned in Chancery to have Nicholas before the Council
when notified, to answer to the king and others when the king wishes to
speak against him.'' ²³
The puzzling part of this entry is that Henry Cove, who with the city
serjeant arrested Sharpenham, was not only himself a mercer, but was
singled out by the complaining Lombards as a principal in the riot, while
his servant Geoffrey Bernham actually headed the band of assailants.
