lXX CAsEs BEFORE THE KING’S COUNCIL

COSFELD v. LEVEYS

The grievanees of foreign merchants were often unheeded or unre-
dressed, but the petition of Godkin Cosfeld was given an unusual degree
of attention. This was due to its bearing upon the relations of England
and the Eastland states at the time. Except with the Hanseatic League,
there was no treaty with them as yet, but diplomatie intercourse was ac—
tively maintained with the various towns and principalities of those parts.
From the early years of Edward II's reign grievances of Eastland merchants
were being heard, that their ships were seized and goods carried off, while
Englishmen made similar complaints of interferences on the part of East-
land privateers.1 Thus there was imminent a war of reprisals.² In 1313
the king was in the midst of negotiations with the towns of Kampen, Lu-
beck, Hamburg, and others, demanding redress for the seizure of a ship
from Boston. Only the magistrates of Kampen were willing to do any-
thing, and they sent envoys to treat with the king and council in England.³
But. when the envoys appeared to be seeking only delays, all further ne-
gotiations were cut short by the king’s decision to levy 2531244, the amount
of the English claims, upon the goods of the men of those towns by way of
reprisal. There was no desire for further hostilities, for Edward had need
of the commodities of those countries, particularly ‘¹ corn and other vict-
uals‚’' ‘¹ in the way of supplies for his Scottish war. In order to protect this
traffic in corn and merchandise the king saw fit in 1315 to issue a special
order to the warden of the Cinque Ports to defend the ships against the male-
factors that were lying in wait to seize them.⁵ The plans of the government
therefore were seriously jeopardized by the success of such malefactors
and the resulting stream of complaints, made by the men of Almain,
of the piraeies being committed off the coast of Lincoln, Norfolk‚ and Suf-
folk. An aggravation in the present case was the fact that two of the de-
fendants, if not all four, were “ king’s mariners,” men who were at other
times commissioned to levy ships and sailors in the king's service. It is
possible that in the present seizure they were aeting on the pretext of the
king’s requirements. There were as yet no special tribunals, like the later
chancery or the admiralty, for dealing with maritime cases, nor did the
council hear them as a rule, and so the matter was referred to the king’s
bench to be treated by the common law. The king concurred in the opinion
of the eouncil that his own mariners should be punished no less severely
than others. Their punishment was certainly not extreme, for they are
soon found again in the king’s service.
