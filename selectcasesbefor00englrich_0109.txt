that he had entered upon an estate without process of law, ejected the
tenants and occupied their lands ¹ in a manner very similar to that described
in the present case. In the parliament of 1402 there were two petitions of
different parties proceeding simultaneously against him. One was of the
parson of Frethorn,2 who alleged that J ames Clifford, having purchased the
manor of F rethorn, laid claim to the church, forcibly ejected the parson and
ent-angled him by all sorts of legal processes in order to dispossess him.
Although the defendant had promised under bonds in the chancery to give
up the church, still he would not allow the parson to have access. For this
offenee Clifford was to answer before the council, but of the result nothing
further is known. The other petition was that of John atte Wode, or At-
wood, with which we are now concerned. Atwood was a lesser landholder
of the county, a tenant in the manor of Chedworth, an hereditary estate of
the Beauchamps. Unfortunately for Atwood, the death of Thomas Beau-
ehamp earl of Warwick deprived him of his natural defender. Since the
manor was at the moment in the king's hand, before it was delivered to the
next heir, the case was the more readily heard by the council. Already in
the previous year Atwood and his wife had presented a petition to the king,
but the only result was a commission of inquisition, followed by another
commission, which for reasons presently to be given had failed in its duty.³
Again they frame a petition addressing it on this occasion to the lords and
commons in parliament. Their allegations are that Clifford had been the
maintainor of Anselm Guise in persecuting them for the past seven years ;
that under a false indictment of felony Atwood had been held in prison for
three years and a half, while his enemies seized his lands and goods. Al-
though he was afterwards acquitted of the felony, he had not yet recovered
his property. The commission of inquisition appointed in the previous
year, they allege, had accomplished nothing because the bailiff and jurors
of the county were in collusion with the defendants. The commissioners
had taken two inquests, the first of which the complainants had challenged,
the second they were not permitted to challenge. Under these conditions
they affirm that it is impossible to obtain justice in the county and ask for a
hearing in parliament. A hearing was granted, but after the first stage of
the proceedings parliament‚ with customary cantion, turned the matter
over to the council for determination. As the record carefully states, the
council then proceeded not on its own authority but “by authority of
parliament.'' The defence had little to say. The examination then was
