of the⁴penal clause in the proemunire, the writ to the sheriff, is given in our
case Lombards v. Mercers (p. 43). There is a tradition of long standing,
voieed by Sir Francis Palgrave and the Dictionary of National Biography,
that the ingenious author of the writ of subpoena was no other than John
of Waltham later bishop of Salisbury. The assumption is based on a com-
plaint of the commons as late as the reign of Henry V, when they rashly
declared that such writs were a novelty, never known before the time of
Richard II, which were invented by the late bishop of Salisbury.¹ Now
John of Waltham was not even a clerk in the chancery in 1363 when the
writ appeared. He is then noticed as a servant of the bishop of Salisbury.²
He was a clerk in the chancery hardly before 1374‚³ master of the rolls in
1381 and keeper of the privy seal in 1386. In view of these conflicting
statements‚ it is very likely that as keeper of the privy seal Waltham was
responsible for the translation of the subpoena into French and its issue
under the privy seal. This was the novelty not known before the time of
Richard ΙΙ, against which the commons had reason to complain. It is
noticeable that there had been no direct complaint against the subpoenas
as originally issued in the chancery, and in the fifteenth century it was the
subpoena under the privy seal that especially stirred resentment. Thus
John of Waltham, if he did not originate the writ, may at least be credited
with converting it into its most detested form, and for this, many would say,
he deserves his evil commemoration.

Thenceforth the subpoena, whether under the great seal or the privy
scal, was the preferred instrument of the council and the chancery. It was
also used, we are told, in the exchequer,⁴ and in special emergencies by
parliament. But instead of adopting it, parliament was averse to a process
so repugnant to the common law, and sought to effect its modification. It
should be used only in emergency, “ as deemed necessary at the discretiori
of the chancellor or the council.'⁷ ⁵ Among the proposals of reform, it was
suggested that the subpoena should be enrolled and made patent, its misuse
should be ground for an exception, and a clerk who issued one wrongly
should be punished, but the king would consent to no such nugatory
measures. At length, under the stress of J ack Cade’s rebellion‚ parliament
legitimized the writs, in riot cases only, for a period of seven years.⁶

There were also writs of attachment and arrest, though such a process
was not always more cogent than a subpoena. In our case of Esturmy v.
Courtemy, a writ of arrest had already failed, when the earl of Devonshire
by a subpoena was told to bring Robert Yeo with him. This was a variant
of the usual subpoena, afterwards known as ducens tecum. A writ of arrest
was commonly issued to a sheriff, a serjeant at arms, and perhaps other
