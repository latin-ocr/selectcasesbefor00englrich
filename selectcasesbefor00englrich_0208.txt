² After 1340.

³ John Barnes or Byernes and John
Bures, sherifl's 1358—59, mentioned below.
The sheriffs were elected on St.. Matthew's
Day <21 September) and came into office
on Michaelmas Eve (28 September).
Liber Albus, pp. 43, 45.

⁴ The following writ of premunire is
given 111 Palgrave, 0νίᾳὶηαῖ Aulhorily os
the Kinq’s Counm'l (1834), p. 131. See also
Sclcct Cases in Chauccry (Selden Soc.
1896), p. xiv.

⁵ Hem-y Cove, citizen and mercer of
London, appears as Henry de Cove as a
witness to a mercer’s will in 1355 (Cal.
Close Rolls, p. 207). He is mentioned as a
plaintiff in a case against a debtor on 4
July, 1358 (Cal. Par. Rolls, p. 83), and in
another similar case on 11 Feb. 1359 (ib. p.
167). He. procured the release of Thomas
Everard (n. 10, infra) and the arrest of
Sharpenham, the latter also a mercer, it is
not clear on what grounds. See Introd. pp.
lxxix-lxxx, supra. Henry Cove's name is
on the list of leading mercers.

θ William Cove of London “on 1 Decem-
ber, 1357, mainperned before the king‘s
001111011 for Thomas of Maldon of London
to answer for certain trespasses committed
in that city upon certain merchants of
Lombardy with which he is charged '’
(Cal. C'Iose Rolls, p. 432). The list of six
mainpernors is as given below. It is
curious that William Cove had himself
been imprisoned in the Tower and released
by mainprise, as appears below. His name
is on the concluding list of leading mercers.

⁷ Servant to Henry Cove, and alleged
by the complainants to have been the chief
leadcr in the,ou trage under investigation.

⁸ Described as “Thomas de Maldon
of London'' and as having been on 1
December, 1357, “a long while detained
(in the Tower) without his fault.'¹ Vide
n. 6 and Introd. p. lxxxi, supra.

⁹ This name does not occur in the list
of leading Mercers given at the end of A;

nor does he appear ever to have held any
office in the City. He was presumably,
therefore, like Bernham, a. person of
inferior consequence. Out of his six main-
pcrnors⁷ as given below, three were mer-
cers, which points to his probably having
been a member of that company, as indeed
do the circumstances of the outrage.

¹⁰ An order had issued for the arrest of
‘⁶ Thomas Everard of London, mercer,'’
but had not been executed (vide infra, p.
46). Upon his petition to the council he
was allowed the benefit of mainprise. The
charge against him was the same as that
against Maldon (note 6, supra) 4 March,
1358. (Cal. Close Rolls, p. 495). In 1366
Alan Everard, mercer, probably a relation,
bequeathed to him his “ term in a brewery
situate opposite St. Laurence in the
JewTy.” (Colendar os Wills in the Court os
Hustinq, London [1890], ii, 97.) For this
combination of trades, permitted by the
custom of London, see Dr. W. Cunning-
ham, Gromh os Eriqlish Iudustry (md Com-
merce (4th ed. 1895), p. 345.

¹¹ In Cal. Close Rolls, 1 November, 1357,
p. 432, is an order to the sheriffs “ to cause
the taking of Adam de Wroxham of Lon-
don, mercer, 10 1)0 superseded by a main-
prise, upon his instant petition, as he fears
that he may be impeached and troubled
for certain trespasses committed in that
city upon certain merchants of Lombardy
with which he is charged, and is ready to
stand to right in all things, and has found
before the Council'’ his seven mainper-
nors as given in the text.. It is to be
observed that Wroksham is not in B de-
scribed as “mercer ’' nor is his name in the
list of Mercers at the end of A, while of his
mainpernors only Alan Everard is to be
found there. From the order to the sheriffs
it would appear that· the City authorities
had contemplated dealing with the case,
but that the council, probably because of
the City’s hostile disposition towards
aliens, had taken it into its own hands. It
