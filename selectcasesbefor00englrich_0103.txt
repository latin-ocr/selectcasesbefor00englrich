On the other hand, the Hansards had no lack of grievance against the
English. In spite of the renewal of their charter, exempting them from
paying more than the old subsidies, certain new customs were being
exacted of thern. In divers towns, they alleged, they were charged 2 s. on
every last of herring; they were not permitted to find wives in England;
in innumerable cases on land and sea their merchants were arrested, de-
tained for great lengths of time and their goods seized.³ Some of the fault
found with them, they pointed out, should ,really be laid against the
Prussians, and so they resented the way Englishmen were in the habit of
confusing them under the name ‘¹ Hansers-Pruciers.'’ Besides general com-
plaints, individuals were constantly presenting petitions in regard to arrests,
detentions, and losses of goods, for which in some cases the council endeav-
oured to afford relief. Too often, however, as in the case at hand, the petitions
failed because of delays and legal obstacles. Especially when the payment
of indemnities was involved, if there was no pressing necessity for giving sat-
isfaction, the government was likely to seek postponements indefinitely.

As to the trade in herring, which resembles the wool trade in its inter-
national irnportance, the competition of foreigners was resented by native
fishmongers‚ because the foreigners under their privileges were exempt
from local dues and requirements of the ports. In this, as in other trades,
there was a running contest over the question whether foreigners should
be permitted to sell by retail or only by gross. On the other hand the com-
mon people favoured the trade with foreigners, because it lowered prices
and broke into local monopolies. The great demand for herring as an
essential food supply and the incessant rise in prices roused the people to
strong expression. According to a complaint of the Londoners‚⁴ the fish-
mongers of the city were in the habit of seizing the fish, without bargain-
ing or asking leave of the owners, and of then selling it at their own price3
after selling the fish, the mongers would pay the former owners as little as
they pleased ; the strangers dared not complain‚ for they stood little chance
of justice in the local courts controlled by fishmongers. The citizens of
London desired that the foreigners might have the king's protection for
bringing to the city fresh fish, which they should be permitted to sell retail
as well as in gross. Apparently the men of Plymouth, described by the
Hansards‚ were acting with the same motives as those attributed to the
fishmongers of London.

The present petition of Conrad Fynk and his fellow merchants was not
the beginning of their suit. It is told how they had been to the council
before, and had been promised restitution of their goods, if they would first
obtain letters from home proving ownership. These letters being now
produced, the chancellor and council ordain that. the money derived from
the sale of the goods in question, 2105, be delivered to them. As a receipt
for this sum the men afterwards made recognition in the chancer-y, but by
some slip in the proceedings the money was not paid. In 1393, the king
