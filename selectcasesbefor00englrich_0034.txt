XXX CASES BEFORE THE KING’S COUNCIL

eouneil, and sometimes they were asked to make report of their findings.
Osten the parties were brought before the council and a discussion was held
before the matter was given to the commission. If properly composed the
commissions were not unser-viceable. In 1429 the commons especially
requested that the justices os the peace might be granted commissions of
oyer and terminer to deal with certain rovers who were comrnitting depre-
dations on the sea.¹ In Duval v. Α rzmdel the petitioners name the men
whom they wish to be appointed as commissioners. The obvious deficiency
01 the commissions, generally disregarded at the time, was the lack of a
coherent system 01 justice. Each case was treated by itself with a mini-
mum of regard 101 precedent. Records of their proceedings were generally
lacking, so that it was once suggested that commissioners who failed to
deliver their processes and pleas into the exchequer should be punished.
Even so, the commissions could never be a substitute for a court 01 strong
competence and speeialized funetion. This began to be appreciated by
Henry VII who extended the powers 01 1110 admirals materially, and by
Ηο111)Υ VIII who placed the court 01 admiralty upon substantial statutory
foundation.

As the antecedent 01 1110 modern court 01 5131 chamber, the council has
generally been represented as a court 01 summary jurisdiction in criminal
cases. Contrary to a prevailing belief this was not its original funetion,
but one that developed in time from 10100 01 necessity. There were always
the crimes 01 81031 violence and oppression, named as riots, routs, con-
federaeies, conspiracies, unlawful assemblages, forcible entries, 101111110-
1111000 01 quarrels, ete.. These were most ‹langerous when perpetrated by
bands 01 31010(1 men, often under the leadership 01 the most prominent
knights in the 0011111105, who might themselves be sheriffs, custodians 01
0351105, justiees 01 the peace, or in collusion with them. They intimidated
courts, prevented the execution 01 writs, corrupted juries‚ held suitors in
durance, and promoted litigation 111 1110 1111010515 01 their retainers. some-
times we uneover a systematic endeavour on the part 01 3 few strong men
in a county by 10100 and fraud to (1150055055 their weaker neighbours. But
during the thirteenth, and most 01 the sourteenth century, the eouncil was
concerned not with the trial of such cases, so much 35 with the elaboration
01 legal ways ancl means 101 dealing with them. For this purpose the writ
01 trespass and several related writs, the court 01 king's bench, the keepers
of the peace, and later the justices 01 1110 peace were each 10 turn established.
Rather than hear a case of extraordinary atrocity the 00110011 would refer it
to a commission 01 oyer and terminer, as in Bur-ton-on-Trent v. Meynell
(p. 41). In the present collection it is noticeable that no case 01 violence is
heard at length by the 00110011, distinctly on this ground, prior to the reign
01 Riehard II. In Par-son os Lanyar v. Conynysby (p. 47) the parties were
brought to an accord. In U qhtred v. M usqrave (0. 54) violence was involved,
