goods in her they seized and took to Blakeney, and have done as they
wished wit-h her. And the merchants and all the mariners that were in the
ship at the coming of the said Robert Leveys and his companions fied for
fear from the ship. For this trespass the said merchant prays that remedy
be afforded him.

[Endorsed‚ 1.· -] The advice of the council.

It seems good to the council, if it pleases our lord the king, that our
lord should command those named as trespassers in these petitions, by
severe letters, to make without delay due restitution of the goods taken or
come before the king at a certain day to answer thereupon and stand trial.

[Q —] The following assent of the king.⁹

The king wills that this should be done and that his own (men) should
not be spared in this (matter) any more than others. For it seems to him
that his own (men) ought to keep the peace better than others. Wherefore
he wills that they should be chastised as well as others.

then remaining in the chancery, (appearing) in response to a certain writ of
the said king directed to the said Gilbert to be before the king himself and
his council in his chancery, to inform the king himself and his council upon
certain matters to be laid before the aforesaid Gilbert in behalf of the said
king, and to do whatever should be enjoined upon him by the said king and
council.⁵ And the said Gilbert, having been sworn and examined ⁵ concern-

lectors in the county of Essex of the tenth and fifteenth recently granted to
the said king by the laity, had alienated his lands, tenements, goods and
chattels before his death, upon his oath declared and acknowledged that
the aforesaid Thomas, being of good and sound mind, three days before his
death, that is, on the sixteenth day of May in the year aforesaid, acknowl-
edged that he owed the said lord the king four hundred pounds and more
out of the aforesaid tenth and fifteenth, and that for this reason as well as
