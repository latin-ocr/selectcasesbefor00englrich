CONFESSIONS OF WILLIAM CHAMBERLAIN AND JOHN MARTIN 73

great threatem'ng and duress forced the said William Chamberlain to swear
to him in regard to everything that he wished to impose, and to keep his
counsel. Having done this they came to London and there in Lombard
street at (the house of) one named Doneaster, a scribe, on oaths of one John
Palmer and John Derby, servants of the said Sir William Clopton, by covin
between them they forged a false testament; and thus the said Doncaster
drew up the testament, mentioning in it that the said Henry had sold the
said manor to the said Sir William Clopton and William Chamberlain for
a certain sum of money, while at the same time the said William and
William at. their house in Gracechurch Street made out a chax-ter to this
effect in fee simple according to the testament, dating it before the death
of the said Henry; this was written by the hands of the said John Palrner,
Sir William’s servant, and the note of the said charter is on paper¹⁸
which still remains in several pieces [in the hands of] the said Sir William
Chamberlain; and (he says) that they sealed the said testament with a
seal signed with an H ., which they had bought at Paul’s Gate, and for all
the said William C hamberlain knows they sealed the same charter with
the same seal, and having done this they threw the said seal into a ditch
near their house; and in case the said charter was sealed with any other
seal this was forged afterwards in the absence of the said Sir William Cham-
berlain, and (he says) that the said sir William Clopton three days after
the death of the said Henry had and still has Henry's seal with his arms
in his keeping; then after these things had been contrived and accom-
plished, they were to have gone with the said false charter to the escheator
of that time in Essex in order to secure his offices in accordance with the
said charter, in deceit and disherison of the heir of the said Henry and
to the exclusion of the king's right. And the said William Chamberlain
seigned sickness at Brentwood‚¹⁹ and took no further part in the pro-
ceedings. And then he felt remorse in his conscience for the great and
very horrible fraud and deception that has been told, and going to Sir
Simon Sudbury ²⁰ the late archbishop of Canterbury, then chancellor,
he confessed the things already described3 whereupon it was laid upon him
as penance to go to the said Sir William Clopton, to withdraw from the
fraud, and further to go to the church where the said Henry is buried,
and there to confess the said fraud; (and he tells) how he went to the
said church and there on a solemn feast day before all the parishioners
he confessed the aforesaid frauds and deceptions.²¹ Afterwards the said
Sir William Clopton would have had the said Sir William chamberlain
release all the right that he had in the said manor, but this the said Sir
William Clopton never did.

reign of the present king, there came into the chancery of our said lord the
