That condition remained unfulfilled and it is probable that the land, hav-
ing been seized into the king’s hand, was released to neither litigant, but
shared the lot of other such properties in the following year.¹¹

TAYLOR v. ROCHESTER

The need for a tribuna-l, such as the council, exercising a control over
royal Officers, and especially over the judges‚ is well illustrated by the case
of Taylor against Sir Solomon Rochester. It belongs to a dramatic moment
of English history when King Edward I imprisoned and fined the judges
who during his absence of three years in Gascony were proved guilty of
having abused their powers and perverted the course of justice. A royal
commission was appointed on 13 October, 1289, to investigate the ‘¹ clamor
miserorum ’' with which the king’s ears were assailed upon his return.
The constitution of this commission and its proceedings are set out at
length in the Introduction to the State Triazs os the Reiyn os Edward the
F irst, published by the Royal Historical Society (Camden Series) in 1906.
The trials which there follow are select cases, and the defendant of these
papers, Sir Solomon de Roucestre, or Rochester, is prosecuted upon other
charges (pp. 11—17, 67-70). In the present instance the offence alleged
against him belongs to 3 February, 1289, and the complaint may have
been one of those which overwhelmed the king on his return home and led
to the subsequent investigation. But the published analysis of the rolls
shews that it was not one of those cases upon which Rochester was actually
tried.

Of the complainant Huwe le Tayllur, or Hugh the Tailor, we know
nothing except that it may be inferred from the substance of his complaint
that his name had already ceased to designate his trade, and that he was,
in fact, a prosperous farmer. Sir Solomon Rochester was an ecclesiastic
who had been employed by Henry III in a legal capacity, and had as long
before as 1274 served as a justice in eyre for Middlesex and after that
year for other counties. That he had ever gone circuit in Wiltshire appears
to be a fact hitherto unknown to his biographers.¹ He is mentioned from
time to time as one of the king’s council. The rolls preserving the inquiries
