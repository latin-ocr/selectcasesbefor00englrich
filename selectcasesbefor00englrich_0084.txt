That Cove should have handed over Sharpenham to the acting constable
of the Tower is another indication that it was an armed force from the
council that first intervened. But why did he take action ‘? It may, of
course, have been simply to divert censure from himself. There are, how-
ever, circumstances suggestive of another reason.

Nicholas Sharpenham, though a mercer, is not described as ‘¹ of Lon-
don,’y neither is his narne to be found in the list of the leading mercers of
London supplied by the complainant Lombards. Further, not one of his
mainpernors is a Londoner, and two of them were persons of importance.
They are all bracketed in C as belonging to the county of Surrey. One of
them, Braghing, then represented Southwark in parliament, and another,
Plummer, was elected for the county in 1360. It is well known that the
vexatious restrictions imposed by the towns upon handicraft and commerce
had the effect of driving trade into the country. This tendency had been
enhanced by the pressure of royal and local taxation upon a town popula-
tion very greatly diminished by the great pestilence of 1348—49.2·¹ What
the city lost, the suburbs gained. The incidents here narrated suggest that
Sharpenham and the inhabitants of Southwark sympathized rather with
the Lombards than with the citizens, and that his arrest and imprisonment
at the instance of Henry Cove, a leading city mercer, and of a city official,
were the outcome of resentment on account of the part taken by him.

The feeling of the citizens is evident enough from the history of the case.
Some six months after the release of Sharpenham upon mainprise, the king,
then at Sandwich, issued a writ to the mayor and sheriffs ordering them
to make inquisition into the riot. It is entered in the City Letter-book G
as ‘¹ Breve ad inquirendum de Merceris qui verberaverunt Lumbardos,'' ²⁵

and is dated 7 October, 1359. No further time was lost. On the day fol-
lowing, the inquisition was taken “before John Lovekyn, Mayor of the
City of London, and John de Chichestre and Simon de Benyngton, sheriffs
of the same city,’' ²⁶ by a jury of twelve. They returned as their finding
