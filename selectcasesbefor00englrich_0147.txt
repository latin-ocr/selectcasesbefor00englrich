CITIZENs OF LONDON υ. ΤΗΕ BISHOP or BATH 12

this day he came to London bringing the rolls which he had had made from
the rolls of the manor of Whittington.²⁸ With these rolls he intended to
render account and offered to do so from day to day for a month‚ and at
the end of the month he had his rolls scaled up, having been commanded to
go home until a fortnight after the following Michaelmas; at that time he
presented himself at London to render the account (appearing) from day
to day for three weeks, and then he was commanded to go home until a
fortnight after Easter; at this time he came to London and offered to
render account (presenting himself) from day to day for a month and two
dayS, and then he was told to go home, since the bishop could not wait to
receive the account, and he departed without §having) a day. Then he was
summoned by writ (to appear) a week after Easter, when he did not come,
and the great distress was awarded (against him), and a day was given upon
the morrow of Trinity in the 22nd year.²⁹ On this day he came and prayed
for a writ to the sheriff to save his revenues, but he was answered that he
shouid not have (the writ) until he had accounted. And the sheriff has
levied 403. from his incomes by command of the bishop. And he himself
was arrested from Trinity until the Feast of Saint Lawrence‚³⁰ nine weeks
and three days, constantly presenting himself from day to day to ren-
der account, and then he accounted. And every time he came and
stayed and returned at his own expense, for himself, his servant and his
horse, for which nothing was allowed him in his account. And in his
account (the bishop) had wrongfully aggrieved him charging him for
various things that he had never received, and failing to allow reasonable
expenses and outlays‚ while for his services of four years, for food and drink,
for robe and suit, nothing had been allowed him; not receiving anything
himself he had been wrongfully and wilfully put to losses of ³316 and thrown
into the Fleet pn‘son, where he had been kept in irons for a year and more,
wherefore he prays for God's sake that by grace of our lord the king remedy
for all the grievances may be afforded him.

To our lord the king shows Nicholas of Clere³l and complains against
the bishop of Bath that while he was rendering his account at Westminster
the said bishop deprived him of the king's letters patent and other warrants
whereby according to the king’s command he had loyally delivered the
king’s treasure; these warrants and letters the bishop had wrongfully dis-
allowed and withheld, and, although he owes nothing, for his arrearages
and by means of other false judgments (the bishop) has imprisoned him
and kept him in prison for three years since the morrow of Epiphany. So
the incomes of all his benefices for the last four years have been taken into
the king’s hand, and withdrawn from him, while he has been deprived of
subsistence here for the past two years and a half that he has remained in
prison under duress for want of means, so that the truth might not be
known. Wherefore the aforesaid Nicholas prays our lord the king that for
the sake of God and his soul he may be oleased to command that the
