commission full report has been made by my said lord and the other wise
[justices] aforesaid in their last parliament held at Gloucester.

LOWESTOFT v. YARMOUTH

Answer to the fourth article which begins: “ Also before this time by
good deliberation of all the lords and eornmons in full parliament for profit
of the king and eommons of the land their charter, etc.''

The said charter was revoked ³¹ without reply and remained revoked
until the report was made in parliament at- Gloueester as above said. By
this report and sundry other evident reasons shewn in the said parliament
of Gloucester by assent of the same parliament for the honour and profit
of our lord the king and of the realm a new charter was granted ³² to the
said town of Yarmouth to have and enjoy all their franchises as well as
they had [them] before the said repeal.

Answer to the fifth article which begins: “ Also whereas by gift of God
the ships which take herrings in Kirkley Road, etc.”

The fishermen are free to pass with their herrings where they please as
1135 been said above save that they shall not sell their herrings in the said
road for the cause above said that it is open forestalling ³³ and ostentimes
before this sundry persons for such forestallings in the said road have been
indicted and have made their fine for this cause to our lord the [king] as
appears by record in the Exchequer.34

Answer to the sixth article which begins: “ Also 35 before this time the
said bailiffs and burgesses had such a 01131101· that all the ships entering
'Kirkley Road, etc.”

The fishermen can 5011 their herring at their will 35 15 abovesaid and in
the fishing 5035011 ³⁵ all the ships called fishers ean certainly enter into the
port of Yarmouth in whatever quarter the wind may be unless it be not
[possible] because of a great storrn and that then one has 31 311 times used
to bring the herring within the said port by certain vessels called lighters ³⁵
and there to 5οΠ 1110111 111 1110 said fair without throwing any herring into
the sea 35 1110 people of Yarmouth will be ready to prove in full parliament.

For the punishment see next note. The
operations of forestallers in the Yarmouth
herring trade are set out in detail in the
ordinance of herrings of 20 February,
35 Ed. 111 (1361), printed in the Statules
os the Realm, i, 369.

³⁴ If convicted on indictment, the whole
value was forfeited to the king: if at suit
of the party grieved‚ half to the prosecutor
and half to the king. The buyer was 1131110
to a fine of the amount paid by him, and
in default two years' imprisonment. 25
Ed. 111, st. 3, e. 3 (1351).

³⁵ Herrings appear at the Norfolk coast
the last week of September, for the purpose
of spawning, and are then in the best con-
dition to become the food of man. . . .

They return to their former haunts about
the commencement of December. Ρ3111101·1
p. 308. “The mackerel fishery is another
great source of employment and profit.
It commences on the tenth of May, and
ends on the tenth of July.'' Ibid. p. 312.

³⁵ The inquisition held 31 Weybrede,
Suffolk, dated 29 July, 1372, which pre-
ceded the charter of 26 August, following,
returned that “the entry to the harbour
has been so dried up of late that no Iaden
ship 0311 enter there in the harbour afore-
said unless it first be unladen in the afore-
said place called Kirkelee-Rode,'' 610.
(Swinden, p. 378). Hence the need of
lighters.
