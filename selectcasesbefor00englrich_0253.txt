Lowns‘ror'r v. YARMOUTH 65

Answer to the first article which begins: “Because in time of the king
Edward, grandfather of our lord the king that now is, it was ordained in
parliament by statute that every liege of the realm should be able to buy
and sell, etc.'⁷ ²⁵

The said charter has not been granted contrary to the said statute, be-
cause all persons as well aliens as denizens are by the said charter free to
sell and buy herring and all other merchandise at Great Yarmouth during
the fair there without disturbance of any,²⁶ and if any private person has
in any way offended against the statute in the charter abovesaid he may
be brought to answer and punished according to the amount of his trespass‚
and besides this there is neither fair nor market within the said seven
leagues by grant of our lord the king by title of prescription nor otherwise
insomuch that if sales and purchases had been suffered within the said
seven leagues of herrings or of other merchandises it would be without
warrant and to the ruin of the said fair, which ought not to be suffered by
statute nor by any law considering the great charges that the town of
Great Yarmouth bears towards our lord the king for the fair abovesaid,²⁷
and that the said town can not be maintained if the said fair be by such
sales and purchases ruined.

Answer to the second article which begins: “Also whereas in time of
the same grandfather in full parliament the twenty-eighth year of his
reign, etc.” ²⁸

The statute made in the said twenty-eighth year has in part lost its
force [because] that by the statute made at a later time it is ordained that
no herring be sold at sea nor in Kirkley Road until the ships be come to
the town of Yarmouth and the ships' ropes drawn on to the land there,
the which statute is ²⁹ yet in force unrepealed and the fishermen are at their
free will to go with their herring where they please, save that they shall not
sell anything within the said seven leagues for the reason premised as above.

Answer to the third article which begins: “ Also by good deliberation
of the lords of England in the time of the same grandfather the thirty-
second year of his reign it was agreed among the people of Yarmouth, the
people of the Cinque Ports, and the Lowestoft tenants of our lord the
king-³³ 30

The said agreement is annulled and repealed because found unreason-
able, as appears by divers inquiries and examinations made before my lord
the Earl of Suffolk and other wise justices *appointed by comniission of
our lord the king, of which inquiries and examinations by force of the said
