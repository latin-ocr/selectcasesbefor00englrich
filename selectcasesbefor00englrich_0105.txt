ESTURMY υ. COURTENAY

The case of Escurmy v. Courtenay is for several reasons one of the most
notable in the present collection. As a case of violence and oppression, it
was the first of a series of trials, such as afterwards pertained to the court
of Star Chamber. It- was a trial on criminal charges of one of the peers of
the realm, for which the council, apart from the house of lords, demon-
strated its competence. Different from former cases of the kind, the matter
was given a complete hearing by the council. The record too is of un-
usual fulness, giving a vivid narrative of the proceedings at every step.
Although the incident was of political importance, no entry was made of
it in the Rolls of Parliament, but in the journal of the council for the 15th
year of Richard II the following minute appears:

On 23 January, l5th year, etc„ there were present the chancellor,
the treasurer, the bishop of Winchester, the bishop of Durham, the
bishop of Chester, the steward, the sub-chamberlain, E. Dalingmgg,
and Stmy, and the justices and serjeants of the king.

And then it was agreed that letters should be issued to the earl of
Devonshire summoning him to come before the council to answer to
certain matters that should be explained to him. And this (he should
do) on his allegiance and under penalty of whatever he can forfeit to
the king, and let him bring with him his servant Robert Yeo under
the same penalty on the next Thursday after Candlemas. And let
another writ be issued to William Grenville sheriff of Devonshire to
come on the same day under the same penalty.¹

The beginning of the trouble here alluded to lay in a quarrel between
Robert Yeo, a retainer of the earl of Devonshire, and William Wyke a
tenant of the earl of Huntingdon. During the previous year William Wyke
had obtained writs against the earl of Devonshire's retainer, which the
latter had treated with contempt. Writs to the sheriff were likewise in-
effeetive because he was in league with the same Robert Yeo. One day
Wyke was caught in an ambuscade and horribly murdered at the instiga-
tion, it is aHeged, of Yeo. Indictments of the persons implicated were
obtained before the justices of the peace, who were in turn threatened by
the earl. And so the quarrel spread until it involved many of the gentle-
men of Devonshire, and was likely to cause a civil war in the neighbor-
hood. It was clearly a case of maintenance‚ an attempt on the part of the
earl to sustain the quarrel of another, coming under the statutes 20 Edw.
III, c. 4 and 1 Richard II, c. 7.² There was also the offence known as em-
bracery, an attempt to influence a jury corruptly, but this had not as yet
been so fully laid down in the statutes.³ Undoubtedly the case belonged
to the council according to an act of parliament, 1 Richard ΙΙ, which con-
