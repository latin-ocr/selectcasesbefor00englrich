tiff against William de la Marche as Dean of St. Martin’s, who as an
officer of the exchequer claimed that he could not be impleaded outside of
the exchequer. And so by the king's command the case was given to the
treasurer and barons of the exchequer, wherein, it is true, William de la
Marche was in the anomalous position of being both judge and party.
Thus we are confirmed in the suspicion that some of the charges were
overdrawn and recklessly made.

It was not the king's intention to supersede the local courts, but to
permit them to continue under their customary form. The mayor’s court
appears to have been taken over by the warden,⁷ the court of Husting was
assembled in the Gildhall on Monday and Tuesday of each week‚⁸ and the
court of the sheriffs⁹ was wont to be held under the presidency of one
sheriff in alternation with the other. The particular complaint against
the existing regime is that the business of these courts had been largely
drawn away from them. This happened in two ways. First there were
the judicial eommsssions, which it was the king’s plan to extend into the
city without hindrance. It was over this issue indeed that the liberties of
the city had been suspended in the first place. After a series of riots and
flagrant cases of gaol breaking in 1285, Edward sent forth a commission to
hold inquisitions in the Tower, and when the mayor and aldermen dis-
puted the right of the commission to hale the citizens before them except
after forty days’ warning, the king seized upon the pretext for taking over
the mayoralty.¹⁰ Henceforth commissions of oyer and terminer, gaol
delivery and the like were issued with frequency. The king did not fail to
recognize the abiJity of the Londoners in appointing them to his commis-
sions, and endeavoured to make these serve the interests of the city. A
commission in 1290 was empowered to hear all pleas which the people
might desire to bring against the king's bailiffs and ministers.¹¹ But what
the citizens resented the most, according to their fifth petition (p. 10), was
the drawing of pleas of all kinds into the exchequer. To obviate the neces-
sity of impleading the citizens beyond the walls, the exchequer was re-
moved in 1289 from Westminster to the Husting,¹² where it was held more
or less of the time that the city was in hand. Now the tendency of the
exchequer to expand its function in the direction of hearing pleas had long
been noticed and attempts had been made to check it. The Statute of
Rhudfflan, 12 Edw. 1, declared that pleas should be held in the exchequer
only in such matters as especially concern the king and the officers of the
exchequer. In spite of this and other similar acts the restrictions were
