fish, after being sufficiently salted, remain
on a floor for twenty-four houm, if in-
tended to be slightly cured, or for ten
days if intended for the foreign market;
they are then washed in large vats filled
with fresh water; spits about four feet
long and of the thickness of a man's thumb

are passed through their heads or gills . . .
and they are then hung up in tiers to the
top of the building, which is usually forty
or fifty feet high . . . the first tier being
about seven feet from the ground. Fires
from oak billet are then kindled under
them and are continued day and night,
with slight intermissions to allow the fat
and oil to drop, until the fish are suf-
ficiently enred, which, if they be intended
for the foreign market, is at the end of
fourteen days, but if for home consump-
tion, three or four days will suffice, whilst
for immediate eating twenty-four hours
will be enough.'' Palmer, p. 309.
