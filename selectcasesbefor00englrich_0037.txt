INTRODUCTION xxxiii

the evidence of an indenture specifying the chattels loaned, the council
decreed full restitution. The earliest cases of enfeofl'ments to use, the most
significant departure in the history of equity, are extremely elusive because
of gaps in the records. The earliest treatment of such a case is revealed to
us by an appeal in parliament occurring in 1380.¹ Certain feoffees, having
been impleaded in the chancery, were there examined, it is said, before the
chancellor, lords and others of the king's councily as to whether the feoff-
ment had been simple or with conditions. The final decree was made by
the king and put into execution by the chancellor. It is of some signifi-
cance that at this time petitions upon the subject began to be addressed to
the chancellor.2 But the petitioners seem still to have regarded the matter
as under the jurisdiction of parliament or the council. This was the view
taken certainly by one petitioner, who in the time of Hemy IV besought
the chancellor to command a tmstee to come before the council, there to be
examined, and to do further what the council should award.3 The first
time that the subject of feoffment to use was mentioned in these words was
in 1402, when the commons apparently desired an act of legislation against
disloyal feoffees‚ because they said “ in such cases there is no remedy unless
one be provided in parliament.” 4 The matter was referred to the couneil,
but whatever action may have been taken further we do not know. In the
same year there was a case before the couneil, Gunwardby and others v.
Tiptost ami others,⁵ in which the feoffees and the beneficiary were plaintiffs.
As the defendants failed to appear, there were several postponements, and
all that we learn is an intimation that the parties were willing to treat out
of court. Amid the general dearth of records it is a natural supposition that
most cases of the kind were disposed of in this manner. In 1423 there is
the minute of an examination before the council of the feoffees of Lady
Neville, who acknowledged that they had been enfeoffed of certain manors
for ‘the purpose of paying the deceased lady’s debts and for making a re-
enfeoffment to her son and heir.⁵ Since these cases all antedate any known
proceedings of the kind in the separate court of chancery, they seem to
warrant the inferenee that like other matters of equitable jurisdiction they
originated in the council, whence the chancellors derived their special
authority and inspiration. F urther the extreme rarity of the cases and
their usual failure to reach a conclusion suggest that the couness, controlled
as it was by conservative influences, did not welcome these suits or give
them due attention. The chancellors, on the other hand, as soon as their
authority was sufficient, received them gladly and professed their readiness
to afford a remedy for every grievance. While the great bulk of equitable
suits was then swept into the chancery, the couneil by no means relin-
