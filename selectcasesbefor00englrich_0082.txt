lxxviii CASEs BEFORE THE KING’s COUNCIL

As late as 1696, Phillips defines a Mercer as “in the City one that deals
only in Silks and Stuffs: In Country Towns, one that trades in all sorts of
Linen, Woollen, Silk, and Grocery wares.” ¹⁴ It is probable that the limi-
tation of the term occurred at a comparatively late date. Hence, the
foreign mercer would be a competitor with traders dealing in a variety of
goods, which have been enumerated as comprising ‘¹ bombazine, fustian,
Suile,¹⁵ Arinour, all sorts of workes made of Iron, or brasse, and other mer-
ceriesff‘N

Lombard Street was the home of the foreign mercer. “ The Merce1y,”
says a writer of 1662, “is gone from out of Lombard Street.’' ¹⁷ It was
not here, however, but in the English mercers' quarter that the outrages
took place which were the subject of inquiry in these documents.

The original complaint of the Lombards has not survived. That they
were mercers cannot be doubted, since their assailants were of that mystery.
That they were subjected to personal violence of a grave description we
shall presently see. Some five years earlier the ill usage experienced by
alien traders at the hands of the citizens had led them to petition that a
member of the council might be specially commissioned to give audience
to their complaints, seeing that the treasurer and the chancellor, to whom
they were referred, had so much important business to transact that they
forgot that of minor inte1·est.¹⁸ The answer given was that the treasurer
and chancellor should hear their complaints when they could and, if pre-
vented, should appoint judges 01· other experts to do so. Whether the
riot was suppressed by the city authorities, or by the peremptory inter-
vention of the council does not directly appear, but the prayer of the
Lombards in document A is a clear indication that they relied upon the
king, and not upon the city, for protection. Further, some of the leaders,
we know, were apprehended and thrown into the Tower, a royal fortress;
others fied from justice. Two, however, as will presently be seen, fell to
the custody of the sheriffs of London,

J ustice was slow in those days. The only dated document here printed
is B, 8 July, 33 Ed. III (1359). We learn, however, from the Close Rolls
that proceedings had been set on foot before 1 November, 1357, to the
summer of which year the riot belongs. At that date one of the accused,
Adam de Wroxham of London, mercer, had already been before the coun-
cil. The Close Roll in questi0n¹⁹ has a writ addressed to the sheriffs of
London, ordering his release upon mainprise. The curious part of the order
is that it purports to be issued upon the prisoner's own petition “ as he
fears that he may be impeached and troubled for certain trespasses com-
