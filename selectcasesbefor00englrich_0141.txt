CITIZENS OF LONDON v. THE BISHOP OF BATH 9

body to the Fleet prison, and the good rnen of the city he amerced in 5100.
for their challenge, and whereas they do not wish the record and process of
a plea heard before them in the Gildhall to be brought before him, which was
never seen or heard of before this time, they pray to the king for remedy.

Moreover by wrongful attachments contrary to every form of law and
by deraignablc distraints he has brought before the exchequer without
commandment of the king Sir John of Gysors ὅ alderman and Margery his
wife and other good men of the cit-y to answer to the prioress of Haliwell ⁷
for their free tenement in London, as has never been done before ; and
because the good men were entirely unwilling to put their tenements under
judgment in this place,8 he seized the tenements into the king's hand and
by the great power that he had so constrained them that they perforce
made peace with the prioress just as she wished, to their own disinheritance
and to the undoing and annuhnent of the franchise of the city, in spite of
the challenge of the good men aforesaid.

Moreover he has caused to be levied upon the city more than 131000
sterling, being the remainder due from the debts of King John, as he sayS‚
and of other times beyond memory; while for this money he is unwilling to
give acquitance or allowance to the citizens either by tally or in any other
way; wherefore they pray for remedy.⁹

Moreover they have rendered account before him for the great fine of
20,000 marks,¹⁰ but he is willing to make neither allowance nor acquittal‚
except for a sum of ³:400, but their acquittances were kept by him more
than a week, and then returned with the seals cracked and broken by bad
keeping, without any allowance having been made; and he has always by
summons and by estreat at the exchequer sued for the entire suni of 20,000
marks, as though nothing had been paid; wherefore the citizens pray for
remedy and (ask) that their acquittances may be allowed none the less
because of the broken (seals).

Moreover the citizens hold of the king the shrievalty of London for 2⁶:400
a year at the exchequer‚¹¹ nor towards this money have they for certain
more than seven pounds of silver, but all the remainder that they provide
toward the ferm they are accustomed to levy partly from pleas and per-
quisites (of the courts), and partly from customs upon divers merehandise,
