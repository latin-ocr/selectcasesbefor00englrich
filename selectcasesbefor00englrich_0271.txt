1386 Also the said suppliants complain against Nicholas Brembre ² that
with the others his accomplices he took upon himself royal authority in
that whereas a charter was granted by the progenitor of our lord the king
to the mistery of the Taylors of London as by the copy of the same the
charter fully makes mention, the which copy follows: “ Edward by the
grace of God king of England and France and lord of Ireland to all to whom
the present letters shall come Greeting. We have inspected ³ the letters
patent which we lately under the seal then used by us in England caused
to be made in these words: ‘Edward by the grace of God king of England,
lord of Ireland‚ and duke of Aquitaine to all to whom the present letters
shall come Greeting. We have been supplicated by the Taylors and Linen
Armourers 4 of our city of London through a petition exhibited before us
and our council ⁵ in our present parliament ⁶ that whereas they and their
predecessors belonging to the same misteries in the City aforesaid have
always hitherto since time immemorial been accust-omed once in the year
to have and to hold their gild within the same City and in the same gild to
make rules for their misteries and to order the condition of their servants
belonging to the same misteries and to correct and amend the shortcomings
of the same for the common weal as well of Α1116 men of the same City as of
