the king sent his writ to the said earl that he should be before the king and
his council ⁴ on Thursday following the feast of Candlemas,⁵ the fifteenth
year of the said king, bringing with him one Robert Yeo⁶ his retainer. On
this day ⁷ the said William declared ³ before the said council that whereas
one William Wyke ⁹ of the county of Devonshire, tenant of t-he lord of
Huntingdon ¹⁰ and of himself, recently pursued divers writs of our lord the
king against the said Robert Yeo, and one of the said writs was taken by
force from the hands of the said William Wyke by the said Robert Yeo and
John Langford his servant and thrown into a well, and then other writs
were directed to the sheriff of Devonshire and delivered to him at the suit
of the said William Wyke to seize the bodies of the said Robert and John.
Whereupon on Lady Day ¹¹ last passed the said John lying concealed in a
ditch attacked the said William Wyke as he was coming to the church ¹²
bare-foot on a pilgrimage, and horribly murdered him by command and at
the instigation of the said Robert Yeo. And afterwards the said William
Esturmy ¹³ sat with John Wadham ¹⁴ justice of the peace in this county,
when the said Robert and John Langford were indicted of the aforesaid
murder by the most worthy knights and esquires of this county, and then
the said William Esturmy went to the house of the said earl emeating to
find good favour, and the said earl said to him in the presence of John
Grenville ¹⁵ knight that he and his ally the false justice and others had in—
dicted his servant the said Robert Yeo falser, whereof he swore on the
cross of his chapel that the said William Esturmy should answer with his
body, calling him repeatedly false traitor, and said that he should have
respite no longer than this day of his aforesaid promise, and moreover the

Devonshire, p. 146). A writ for the arrest
of Yeo and his servant John Langford had
been issued on 10 January (Cal. Pat.
Roas, 282), but under the protection of
the earl they could not thus be reached.

⁷ The meeting of the council for this
day is on record. See lut-rod, p. ci.

⁸ Apparently the case was opened with-
out petition or bill. No petition has been
found in Ancl. Pet.

manor of Cocktrie, of the parish of Peters

¹⁰ This was John Holland, half brother
of Richard 11, a fact that may account for
the vigour with which the case against the
earl of Devon was pressed. The earl of
Huntingdon held a number of estates in
Devon. Dugdale, ii, 78.

¹³ Esturmy was not a justice of the
peace in this year, but it was customary
for the justices to invite others to sit with
them.

¹⁴ Son of Sir John, of a well known
family which derived its name from a
place Wadham in the parish of Knowston
(Prince, Worthies, p. 587). He was a jus-
tice of common pleas in 1388, a serjeant at
law in 1390, a trier of petitions in parlia-
ment and for many years iustice of the
peace in Devon and other countiae. He
was also member of parliament for the
shire in 1400.

¹⁵ The Grenvilles were a family located
at Stow in the northeastern part of Corn-
wall and at Biddiford in the northwest of
Devon. The mother of this Sir John was
a daughter of the late Hugh Courtenay,
and he was a cousin of the earl of Devon.
He was sheriff at the time of the present
case, 1391- 92, and represented the shire in
parliament in 1388, 1394, 1397, and 1402
