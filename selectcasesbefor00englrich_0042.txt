xxxviii cAsns BEFORE THE KING⁵S COUNCIL

persons “to give information and to do and receive whatever shall be
required by the council.'⁷ In the reign of Richard II a reward was offered
to those reporting evasion of the customs, and again announcement was
made that informers would be heard. In the reign of Henry IV there is
extant a lengthy deposition of one William Stokes, who sets forth how
it is the duty of every loyal subject to safeguard the honour and profit of
the crown, and informs the council of certain illegal exportations of wool.¹
Sometimes the information was presented in a petition, suggesting the arrest
of this or that party, in one instance pointing out a spy.² In 1420 there is
a letter of Thomas Erpingham, himself a member of the council, acquaint-
ing the chancellor of the probability of a riot in Suffolk.³ Parliament was
with good reason suspicions of informers and was as a rule averse to the
system of trial without indictment, but there were times, nevertheless‚ when
it sanctioned the practice. In 1423 the commons expressed their willingness
that in cases of persons carrying gold out of the country, any one giving
notice of the fact to the couneil or the treasurer should receive half of the
goods forfeited, but the king consented to his receiving only a fourth part.⁴
Again the Statute of LiverieS, 8 Edw. IV, e. 2, declared that every informer
should be admitted in the courts to sue for the king and himself, being
required only to swear on a book to the truth of his assertions, and such
information should stand instead of bill or original writ. Finally the Statute
of the Star Chamber‚ 3 Hen. VII, warranted the procedure of the council
“ upon bill or information.⁷⁷

Next in order were the writs of summons and arrest, by which parties
could be cited, and, if need be, compelled to appear before the court. It is
well known that in the reign of Edward III there were devised in the chan-
cery certain summary writs, the quibusdam certis de causis, the proemunire,
and the subpoena. The first appears as early as 1346, the latter in 1363.
These differed from any corresponding instruments of the common law in
their initial clause, failing to give cause of the suit or prosecution‚⁵ and in
the method of their issue without registry or enrolment. From what is
now known, these writs were not derived from any example set by the
ecclesiastical courts, but were evolved out of the formulae already in use
for administrative rather than judicial purposes. The significant clause
quibusdam certis de causis commonly appears in such writs and precepts as
the certiorari and supersedeas from the time of Edward I. Likewise the
final penal clause was new only in its particular application.s The first use
