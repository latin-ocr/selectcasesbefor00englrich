CITIZENS OF LONDON v. THE BISHOP OF BATH 13

prisoner be delivered, and to grant him hearing and justice in his court, and
to provide auditors before whom the truth may be shown and specified for
the king, and that just allowances may be made him, and that all wrongs
that have been inflicted upon him may be undone and redressed. The
auditors whom our lord the king at the intercession of the queen of Navarre
had previously appointed are as follows: Sir William of Vale11ce,³·2 Earl
Warenne³³ and Sir Robert of Hertford.³⁴ Seeing now before the departure
of the cardinals,³⁵ by intercession of the cardinal of Gascony our lord the
king has granted the aforesaid Nicholas hearing and justice in his court,
may our lord the king be pleased to grant the aforesaid audience and
commend his petition.

To our lord the king Roger Paw of Catesby and Henry his brother
declare that whereas they were collectors and buyers of wool for Cleysaloe
merchant of Flanders in the county of Leicester, (who) paid them of his
money 55 marks, with which they purchased 5 sacks of wool at the price of
11 marks a sack, and while they were collecting it in a certain place,
namely at Melton and Gadesby, there came the aforesaid merchant and
received the wool at a certain weight‚ had it put into sacks, and considered
himself well satisfied with the purchase. Subsequently by command of the
king all the wool (and) merchandise of aliens were seized into the king's
hand,³⁶ so that the sheriff made seizure of this wool together with other
merchandise of aliens; (when) the aforesaid Cleysaloe perceived that,
because he could not keep possession of the aforesaid wool, he came to the
exchequer of our lord the king, and purchased a writ venire facias against
the aforesaid Roger and Henry to respond for the aforesaid 55 marks with
which they had purchased the aforesaid wool. The aforesaid Roger and
Henry carne to court and alleged that he wrongfully claimed this debt
against them since he well knew that the money had been spent for the 5
sacks of wool which he himself had received and filled, and (they say that)
whereas the wool remained in the care of the sheriff as forfeited chattels to
the use of the king, the aforesaid Roger and Henry were by command of
the treasurer committed to the Fleet prison on account of the 55 marks,
and there they have remained since the fortnight after last Michaelmas,
and there they still remain; wherefore for the sake of God and the souls of

Berard de Gouth or Got, Archbishop of
Lyons, mistakenly called Archbishop of
Bordeaux (Eubel, Hierarchia, i, 11), here
mentioned as cardinal of Gascony; the
other was Simon de Beaulieu, Bishop of
Praeneste.

³⁵ The command here referred to has
not been found, but there is an order
of 5 Nov. 1294 to the warden of the
cinque Ports, to the effect that while mer-

chants of friendly countries might come
and go, the goods of all persons under
the dominion of the king of France
should be confiscated (Cal. (Ἴ. Rolls, 22
Ed. Ι, 375). It is likely that Just such
an order was issued to London. Hence-
forth licenses to merchants for the
exportation of wool were granted on
condition that none of it should go to
France.
