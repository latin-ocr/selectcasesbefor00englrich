but they were then reputed to be rare.¹ Irregular as it was, the. thing was
done in parliament, in the king's bench, and before the justices in eyre.
The king's council took up the practice and carried it to such a point that
in the reign of Edward III there began to be heard protests. The statute
of the fifth year, that no man should be attached by any accusation against
the Great Charter or the law of the land, probably had reference to just
this practice. The statute of the twenty-fifth year (5, e. 4) expressly
enacted that none should be taken by petition or suggestion before the king
or the council, unless by indictment or presentation. This act, if it had
been carried into effect, would have precluded one of the most characteristic
proeesses of the council. No doubt there was need of a system of accusa-
tion apart from the jury in favour of individuals It* is on record how a
certain party, not daring to make his accusation openly, went to a father
confessor and revealed the fraud that was being perpetrated upon his
mother’s will, in the hope that the matter would thus be made known to
the king’s council.2 But as is frequently disclosed the danger of the system
lay in its being applied on the slight-est suspicion and even falsely and mali-
ciously. In the twenty-eighth year there was an outcry that the king's
purveyors, because legal proceedings had been taken against them, were
making false suggestions in order to bring their opponents before the king
and council.³ The Statute 27 Edw. III, several times reenacted, required
accusers to offer security to prove their suggestions before the council as
well as in other courts. Parties gave assurances in various ways, offering
to prove their assertions, swearing to their truth, and promising to give
satisfaction if their complaints should not prove to be true. In one case an
accuser declared himself ready to prove all things contained in his bill on
pain of loss of life and ehattels.4 By act of parliament in 1394 the chancel-
lor was given power to require the parties suing for writs of summons and
arrest to find sufficient pledges and surety for the truth of their sugges-
tions.⁵ Thus there arose the practice, adopted in the chancery and also in
the council, of requiring the names of persons giving surety, the plegii de
prosequendo as they were called, to be written in the margin of the bill. An
example of this device is given in Norton v. Colynyborne (p. 115). Since
security of this kind was not always required by the council, the sear of
malicious aceusations was hardly diminished. There was an inclination
also on the part of defendants to offer surety. Onc'e the parties against
whom information had been laid offered their bodies for due punishment,
in case the charges were found to be true.⁵

Encouraged by the council, the practice of seeking information became
a wide-spread system of public espionage. One of the writs in use cited
