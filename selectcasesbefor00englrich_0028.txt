nii οΑ5Ε5 BEFORE THE KING’s COUNCIL

justices. The larger court was not ‘¹ a higher power,” as Maitland once
said, much less was it a different power; it was essentially the same court
however much it gained in dignity and collective wisdom.

By the time of Edward I the king's bench had become predominantly a
court of common law. It is so regarded by Britton‚ who says of the justices
“ their jurisdiction and record shall extend so far as we shall authorize by
our writs.’⁷¹ He also mentions it as an alternative court to the king’s
council. The same distinction will be found in the records of the court
itself. At the same time the rolls are interspersed with conciliar and par-
liamentary cases, such as Valence v. Bishop os Worcester (p. 5) and Rex v.
Gerdeston (p. 27). There were also variants of law and procedure, such as
the acceptance of a writ not in legal form, the suit of 3 foreigner, a trial
without indictment, which were significant of the existence potentially of
two tribunals, though they were not so understood at the time. In one case
a litigant was told to 5110 31 common law if he wished; ² the process then
before the court was not such. Late into the reign of Edward 111 1110
10001(15 still 001113111 1110 proceedings of both court and council. But by that
time, as we shall shew, the features of 0011011131 procedure had become so
distinct from the common law, that there was no longer any reason for
confusion.

In its earliest days the exchequer was not named as a court. The tri-
bunal was designated preferably as “the king's court in the exchequer.”
There seems to have been a survival of this idea in the practice of the
council sitting in the exchequer, as illustrated in our case of the Bishop os
Sabina v. Beclewynde (p. 18). This was properly an exchequer case, accord-
ing to the privileges of this body, in that it affected the rights of one of its
officers; it was also a case for the council in that it was 3 (115111110 over the
king's right in a question of 011111011 311(1 state. The court was then 3 special
assemblage of lords and officers, who were called by the king’s writ into the
exehequer, to hear the matter and, in the words denoting its extraordinary
character, Η01·(13111 what should be done according to right and reason.''
The proceedings were after the methods of the counci13 a reading of the
petition, 1110 pleadings of the parties in turn, a search of the records, a hear-
ing of written evidence, deliberation and discussion, and finally a deter-
mination of the question and a report to the king. The process was after-
wards read before the treasurer and barons of the exchequer, who ordered
it to be engrossed upon the Memoranda Rolls, and a copy scaled with the
5031 of the exchequer was given to the successful defendant. In these pro-
ceedings it seems quite inadequate to say that the council was merely 3
reinforcement of the exchequer, or happened at the moment to be occupy-
ing its house.³ It was rather the original court, which was still immanent
in the exchequer, and served for the occasion by the administrative agencies
