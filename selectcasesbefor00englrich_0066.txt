lxii CASEs BEFORE THE KING’s COUNCIL

the time set by canonical law. This was the law of “ lapse‚’' a canon es-
tablished by the Third Council of the Lateran in 1179 to the effect that in
cases of vacancy appointments shall not be held indefinitely in suspense;
if the regular patron does not act within six months, the bishop of the dio-
cese may name a candidate; if he does not appoint‚ the chapter may3 and
if all others fail, then the metropolitan may dispose of the place.³⁷ Al-
‘though the pope is not mentioned in the canon, it probably worked in his
favour. Now Theobald had held the treasurershjp for six years, and his
successor for three years more, before any right of the crown was asserted.
The plea was therefore an exception of plenarty, that is, the place was filled
ancl the possessor should not be disturbed³⁸ In the king's behalf it was
argued to the contrary that, however it might be with other patrons,
against the rights of the crown “ there is no lapse nor ought there to be.''
Upon this ground the case was decided, but as a statement of law it was an
extreme claim for the rights of the crown‚ that was not maintained with-
out modification later.

The judgment of the council, which was duly enrolled and set forth in
letters under the great seal, was far from being the end of the controversy
over the treasurership of York, much less of the general question of pro-
visions. In two or three passages of the record there are allusions to the
responsibility resting upon Bedewynde of maintaining not only his own
right but the rights of the crown -— this he is admonished he should do
“ with all his might.” The sequel shows that he had need of great patience
and energy in contending with the ecclesiastical proeesses that were im-
mediately begun against him. On 5 September, the pope required the
archbishop to cite him for having despoiled Francis Gaetano of the treas-
urership.³⁹ Edward II endeavored to defend his clerk by requesting Pope
Clement V not to carry the matter further ; were the king to connive at
at such proceedings‚ he wrote, ‘¹ his nobles would not endure it.’⁷ “¹⁰ Still
the papal processes were not discontinued. At the same time Bedewynde
as a pluralist had need of a papal dispensation in order to retain the bene-
fices that he was holding uncanonically.4¹ At one moment he seemed on
the point of yielding, when the king ordered the warden of the Cinque Ports
to arrest Walter Bedewynde or John Bush in ease either of them should
attempt to cross the sea to answer in any court outside the kingdom.⁴²
Thus for twenty years Bedewynde was defended by letters of protection
and inhibition, but the king of England could not prevent the case being
taken up in the papal court. As many as three hearings took place there,
before Bedewynde died in 1328,’13 pendente lite.
