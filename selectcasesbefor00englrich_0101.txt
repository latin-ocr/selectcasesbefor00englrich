charter to raise prices for their own benefit. Controversy followed as to
the topographical accaesibility of the town. At the worst, contended Yar-
mouth, goods could be brought in by lighters from Kirkley Road; to which
the petitioners replied that lighterage was both dangerous and costly.
Similarly, pedlars and· others concerned with land-transport were alleged,
and denied‚ to find the town inconvenient of access.

regrettable lacunae.

TAYLORS υ. BREMBRE

The stormy political career and tragic end of Sir Nicholas Brembre,
mayor of London in 1377, 1378—79‚ and 1383-84, are narrated at length by
the learned pen of Mr. J. H. Round in the Dicliomzry os National Bioqraphy.
It is enough, therefore, to say here that he was a partisan of the absolutist
policy of Richard II and an enemy to John of Gaunt and Wycliffe. Within
the city his aims were oligarchical. He was a member of the wealthy
company of the grocers, which numbered among its brethren eight alder-
men, one-third of the whole body.l With the support of these and other
of the great companies he sought “ to deprive lesser companies of any voice
in the city.” The opposed companies ranged themselves as the victualling
and non-victualling trades.² The former being represented by the grocers,
fishmongers, and mercers. Brembre was a politician of the “ mailed fist.'’
The Rolls of Parliament for 1386 contain petitions against him from “ the
folk of the Mercerye of London‚” from the “ Cordwaners‚’' the Founders,
the Saddlers, the Pa'mters, the Armourers, the Pinners, the Embroiderers,
the Spinners, and the Bladesmiths. Of these the editors of the Rolls note
that most of them are “ imperfect,'’ and they print only the first two. The
petition here printed appears to have been separated from the others, and
to have escaped their notice.

The Mercers⁷ petition to the council which they print,³ complains that
the election of Brembre as mayor in 1383 was effected by armed force and
the slaughter of his opponents; that he governed opprffisively with a high
hand, that he burnt records which furnished precedente adverse to his
measures. The petition of the “Cordwaners,'' which belongs to the year
1386‚⁴ is addressed not to the council only,· but to the king and lords
generally.⁵ While the mercers use English, the cordwainers prefer French.
