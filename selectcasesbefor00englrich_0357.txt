dors sent in 1475 to treat with France
(Foedera, xii, 15).

¹³ or Part, commissioner of array and

Westmoreland, sheriff of Cumberland in
1471, os Westmoreland in 1475; a king's
equerry since 1468, one of the ambassa-
dors sent to France in 1475, a member of

¹⁵ or Grey, of Little Tilbury, Essem an

a Knight of St. George in 1467 (ibid. 38),
granted the manor of Tilbury in 1475 and
the lordship of Clavering in Essex for life

1482 to act as vice-marshal of England
(ibid. 317).

¹⁵ These words are apparently the Eng-
lish equivalent of the Latin in pleno con-
silio and the French en plein conscil, which
frequently occur. Professor Pollard has
argued that the adiective plenum or plein,
used in connection with parliament, means
“ open ” or ‘¹ public '¹ rather than ‘¹ fun '’
and is equivalent to the French playn (Enq.
Hz‘st. Rev. vol. 30, p. 660). The evidence
seems to me to the contrary. where playn
was meant, that word was used (ibid) In
one instance we have en plein confort and
en plein parlcmenl side by side (The Kiny's
Council, p. 495), where the meaning can
only be “full ” 01· “ οοῐῐιρ1818.” A ¹¹ full ‘'
parliament or council, it is true, need not
be large. Little stress was laid upon the
size even of great eouncils (ibid. p. 106).
The ‘¹ fulness '³ consisted rather in the com-
pleteness of its legal form and sanction.
See also ‘¹ plein raetitucion ” in Petitz'on os
the H ansards, p. 76, and “plein parlamenff
and “plein relacion '¹ in juxtaposition in
Lmvestost v. Yarnumth, p. 66.
