over-great distress shall not be taken; if a debtor can find surety until a
day before the time limited, the distress shall be released in the meantime.¹⁵

Other charges, that touch upon the recognized abuses of the exchequer,
need merely be mentioned. A man is held to account for what he is not
legally an accountant (Pier of Tadcaster and Pier Jacob, p. 10); there is
failure to give acquittance or allowance for actual expenditures (Henry
le Bole, p. 11); the treasurer and barons are sometimes too busy to receive
accounts (Pier Jacob, p. 11); the property of wards was exploited and ex-
cessive relies demanded (John of Erley⁷ p. 14); imprisonment for debt
might go on indefinitely, sometimes for personal vengeance (Gerard
Mauhan, p. 15); purveyance of horses, armour, beer and other articles
without compensation was only a form of confiscation (William of Here-
ford, p. 16, Richard the Brewer, p. 17, etc.). In all these charges against
william de la Marche it is noticeable that in only one case is he accused of
taking things for his own use (william Savage, p. 15).

As to the revenues, it was understood that the suspension of civic
liberties was an opportunity for special fines and taxes levied directly upon
the people. “ It is an evil thing‚⁷' a chronicler exelaims, ‘¹ to fall into the
hands of the king. So beware! ’' ¹⁶ In the king's desperate straits for money,
the merits of the system depended upon his success in thus enlarging his
revenues. He met with practical difficulties however in collecting the
sums demanded. On his return from Gascony in 1289, there was a present
of AEIOOO which the citizens offered by way of curtesy. The money was
to be levied by poll, but many of the inhabitants were reported to be so
poor that they could only give pledges for future payment, and these pledges
were afterwards sold for what they would fetch.¹⁷ When Edward came to
London again in 1290, the sum had shrunk to 1000 marks. The ingenuity
of the treasurer brought forth a claim to 21000 of a debt in arrear from the
reign of King John. The fine of 20,000 marks here mentioned held over
from the reign of chry III ¹⁸ and was being paid in driblets from time to
time. In 1291 the common council proposed to borrow 20 s. from the
wealthy in each ward, to present to the king and council, with a view to
the recovery of the city’s franchises and in respect of the account of the
20,000 marks. In 1292 the sum of 1:383 8 s. 5 d. was allowed.¹⁹ At this
rate a large part of the sum remained unsatisfied in 1302, when the king
commuted it for ιςΕΞΙΟΟΟΡῡ In 1294 money must be had for the war with
F rance, and §2000 found in St. Paul’s Church was appropriated.2¹ But
the ferm of 3400 a year, the citizens tell us, was raised with difficulty be-
cause the sources from which it was derived had diminished. Customs on
