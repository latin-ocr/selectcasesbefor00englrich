That the countess was a party to these proceedings is evident from the
next clause in the patent. Within the quarter of a year after the divorce
is pronounced, the earl is to enfeoff her of 740 marks (5493 3s 4d) a year of
land in the towns of Graham¹4 and Gretwelle,¹⁵ and the soke of Gretwelle,
and to give security for the due persor-mance thereof. He was also to be
discharged from his recognizance in ..1:200 for the maintenance of Darne
Joan pending the suit16 and for the costs. It is significant of the troubled
state of the country that patents of protection were issued from Lincoln,
where parliament was sitting, to him and to Matflda Neirford for them and
their “men, advocates, proctors and witnesses‚ and their servants and
witnesses‚” for their safe conduct.¹⁷ The suit was promptly determined, the
marriage with the countess being held valid. She had 110 issue, but in order,
it may be inferred, to defeat, at least in part, her claim to dower, as well as
to make provision for Matilda de Neirford and for his sons by her, the earl on
1 July⁷ 1316)ss surrendered to the crown a number of his mauors in Surrey,
Sussex, Wales, Yorkshire, Lincolnshire, and elsewhere. Of those in Surrey,
Sussex, and Wales he received a regrant by patent, dated Lincoln, 4 August
of the same γεω-,19 The ternis of the patent were to the earl for life, with
remainder successively to “John de Warenna and Thomas de Warenna,”
sons of Matilda Neirford in tail male.. Of those in Yorkshire he received
a regrant for life, with remainder to Matilda Neirford for life, with the
same successive remainders to their two sons Of those in Lincolnshire he
received a regrant for life, with reversion to the king and his heirs, of the
mauors and towns of Staunford <Stamford) and Grantham. To this de-
ferred consideration forits regrants the crown added the manor of Kensyng-
ton, Surrey, of which it retained possession. Nor did it long abstain from
anticipating its reversionary claims. By a deed of 25 October, 1317, the
earl released the Lincolnshire manors.2⁰ warenne never lived with his
wife again. She quitted England in 1337 and died abroad in 1361. His
sons by Matilda Neirford, John and Thomas de Warenne, appear to have
died before him. He himself played a foremost part in the stormy politics
of the day, as may be seen in Hunter's Deanery os Doncaster,²¹ and in the
Dictionary os N ational Bz'oqraphy, and died in 1347.
