XVi CASES BEFORE THE KING’S COUNCIL

dealt not with such causes as other courts of ordinary justice might con-
dignly punish, ne diqnitas hujus curiae vilesceret. Thirdly, it very rarely
did sit, lest it should draw the king's privy eouncil from matters of grace,
pro bono publico, to hear private causes, and the principal judges from their
ordinary courts of justicefl ¹ Here the fundamental mistake, which has
often been repeated, lies in the thought that there was a judicial body in
the star chamber apart from the king's privy council. From time to time,
it is true, there appear to be potentially two branches of the council, the
one attending the king wherever he might be, at home or abroad, often
designated as “ about the king's person,” “whom he might have with
him,” the other remaining at London or Westminster. Sometimes there
was correspondenee between the two branches, or a conveyanee of bills
from one to the other, but never was any organic separation effected.
Much less was there any division of functions, such as consultation and
administration for one group and judicature for the other. It was no doubt
because of the greater weight of judicial business and the close connexion
with other courts, that the council at London from the time of Edward I
became the prineipal centre. The king himself was rarely present, and
dealt with his councillors there largely by correspondence (e. g.‚ Sabina v.
Bedewynde, p. 18). This was the preference expressed by the commons in
1406, when they asked the king to send all bills, by some of the councillors
attending him, to the council remaining at Westminster.2

Different from the modern Court of Star Chamber‚ the medieval council
had no specific organization as a court. Though it might be called curia, it
bore no name comparable to the “ High Court of Parliament.'’ It had no
roll, no seal, no process pertaining exclusively to it. There were no stated
judicial sessions or law days, though it was declared on occasion to be
“ sitting judicially.⁷’ ³ It customarily obser-ved the terms set for the king's
courts, but did not even then manage its judicial business in any way apart
from political and administrative. There is a slight suggestion also that
Wednesdays and Fridays, the traditional days of the later court, were
appropriate days for suitors.‘¹ The council was well fitted for judicial work
in its personnel, which included, in addition to lords and knights, an ez
officio element in the justices of both benches, the barons of the exehequer,
the serjeants and others “ skilled in the law.'’ As to the position of these
professional men, there has been considerable discussion whether they are
to be considered as “members ” of the council or merely ‘¹ advisers '‘ therein.
We shall avoid confusion, if in this connexion we drop the word “member''
as an anachronism. In the middle ages a man was a “ councillor '⁷ or
“ counsellor,'' “ sworn of the couneil,” “retained of the council,” “ ap-
pointed to the council,” but never would he be spoken of as a ‘⁴ member.’'
