INTRODUCTION xli

The parties were told to come before the couneil, ubicumque suerit, ou a
given day, ten days or a fortnight being usually allowed in the wrsts, and
then they must attend from day to day, even from hour to hour, until their
names were called at the door of the chamber. According to the circum-
stances they were to appear “ in proper person‚'' or, if allowed in the writ,
they might appear by proxy or attorney. Litigants were likely to appear
in person at the first sitting, and then with the permission of the court leave
the matter to attorneys. In all civil suits the parties were required to make
full submission to the court, in alto et basso. This was deemed essential, for
one could hardly be bound without his own consent to an extra-legal pro-
cedure. Once it was declared that without a submission the trial could not
go on.¹ The final award was likely to be made expressly on the ground of
such a submission. Petitioners often expressed their willingness to submit
to the council, and sometimes offered bonds as high as 5:5000? Thus no
exception could afterwards be taken to the jurisdiction of the court. The
case was opened with the reading of the bill, or its equivalent, and then if
desired an adjournment was taken. The pleadings followed. In this fea—
ture there was a gradual change from the oral pleadings of the first half of
the fourteenth century to the written pleadings afterwards elaborated.
The council was slower than the courts of common law to change to written
pleadings, and then it. adopted the methods of the civil law in the answer,
replication, duplication, triplication, etc„ which like certain other features
of equitable procedure are noticed first in the courts of common law.³ Still,
oral pleadings in the older style continued into the reign of Richard ΙΙ.4
The object of each plea was to defeat the claim of an opponent on grounds
independent of its truth. It was likely to present an exception, rarely a
demurrer. In contrast to the method of the common law the aim of the
pleadings was to reduce the issue, rather than join the issue. The great
danger of this form of argument was prolixity, such as became the scandal
of the admiralty and the later court of chancery: But the council was suc-
cessful in keeping its proceedings within reasonable bounds. Replications,
which were restricted in their scope to the matter already outlined, were
infrequent, while duplications and triplications were almost unknown.⁵ A
variant of the traditional practice is seen in the method of reducing the
claims of the parties to a series of articles, in which each claim and answer
are dealt with singly.⁵ After the pleadings, the matter in dispute was put to
proof according to the needs of the case. Most often this consisted of an
examination of the charters, letters, and other writings which the parties
were required to bring. The record of any court, or an exemplification,
