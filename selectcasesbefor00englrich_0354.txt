⁴ Au arbitration, such as was often

agreed upon to settle 3 (11511010 privately

useful instead of 3 jury when the question
was complicated or technical. Sometimes
it was proposed in 3 spirit os compromise
(e. g. Nem'lle v.Ne1·z'lle‚ Introd. p. cx). But
the method laboured for 3 long time under
many disadvantages: the courts often set
such 3 (10015100 aside on technical ground;
however the parties might bind them-
selves, still the arbitration was not a court
and had no process to compel obedience,
so that one or the other party might be
compelled to go to court for the original

agreement to accept the award. Α needed
