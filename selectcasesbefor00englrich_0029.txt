of this department. There were other cases before “the council at the
exchequer,” according to a contemporary phrase, but their great length
has deterred us from presenting them here.

More than of the exchequer, our selections will shew the vital connexion
of council and chancery. It is a singular phenomenon that the court of
chancery‚ which began with a closely restricted jurisdiction, should in time
be granted the greatest amount of discretionary power. This development
was not an expansion of the original functions of the court, which were
purely legal and formal; much less was it due to any inherent capacity of
the chancery or its officers. Neither was it primarily an outgrowth of the
individual powers of the chancellor. The origin of a court of extraordinary
authority is found rather in the practice, noticed early in the fourteenth
century, of assembling the council whenever a point arose in the chancery
requiring discussion and deliberation. It might per-tain to the formulation
of a writ or a case under adjudication. The assemblage‚ known as con-
silium in cancellaria, was larger or smaller according to the interests in-
volved, or perhaps the convenience of the occasiom sometimes it was
predominantly of barons, often of judges and office1·s.¹ At this time it is
the same whether we speak of the common law or the equitable side of the
chancery, a distinction that can be perceived not in the composition of the
court but in the character of the cases. In its primitive form the court was
an assemblage especially called for each separate case. It was given author-
ity ad hoc by the king's writ directed to the chanceilor, who was to summon
the counci13 with a certain degree of discretion he is to call “those remaining
at London,” “ whom he sees fit‚'' or ‘¹ enough to do justice.'' The chancel-
lor then cites the parties to appear, he presides over the court, he asks a
question, he answers an objection, he executes the order of the court. His
functions enlarge rapidly. Before the end of the reign of Edward III
suitors were addressing petitions to the chancellor, or the chancellor and
council. In these petitions, it does not appear that suitors regard him as
more than an executive officer and their most feasible means of approach
to the council. By the time of Richard II he was able to summon the court
on his own authority without the initiatory writ of the king. Yet it is not
shown that even then the chancellor was ever sole judge or even the pre-
dominant judge in the court over which he presided. The stage of develop-
ment then reached is illustrated in the suit of J oan Celers,² who petitioned
the chancellor for the recovery of money that had dropped out of a cart into
the road and was stolen by “ certain men '’ of Dunstable. In consideration
of her poor estate and lack of means to sue at common law, the chancellor
caused the men, who were reputed to be the finders of the money, to be
