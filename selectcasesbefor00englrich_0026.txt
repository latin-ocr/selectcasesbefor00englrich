XX CASES BEFORE THE KING'S COUNCIL

difficult now to count as many as a hundred for the two centuries prior to
1485. Loss of records has without doubt occurred, but there is corrobora-
tive evidence that the loss was not a large sraction of the whole. It was
impossible in fact for the councillors of the fifteenth century, in addition to
their administrative and political work, fully to perform their judicial duties.
The need of a special branch of the council for this purpose was felt long
before such a departure was attempted.

4. THE COUNCIL AND OTHER COURTS

A problem that has been discussed before, but which seems still open to
argument, is the relation of the council to several kindred courts of law.
The council, says Dicey, “is nothing more than the Curia Regis when
separated from the judicial tribunals.'' ¹ In the words of Sir Matthew Hale
it is ‘¹ the common mother '’ of all the courts of justice in the realm.² To
some this has seemed a mere superficial theory; even if it be accepted, it
does not explain the manner of differentiation and the continued connexion
of the parent stem with its offshoots. No two courts in their formation were
alike, and analogies were slightly heeded. Some of the records before us,
in addition to other pieces of evidence, may help to elucidate the matter.

In the time of Edward Ι there were several bodies in the state that were
not as yet organically distinct, namely parliament, the council, and the
king's bench. The exchequer, while it had reached a definitive form as a
department of finance, in its judicial functions was still as uncertain of its
field as the court of king's bench. In his illuminating introduction to the
Roll of the Parliament of 1305 Maitland has pointed out that in the four-
teenth century “ a parliament is rather an act than a body of persons. . . .
Any meeting of the king's council that has been solemnly summoned for
general purposes seems to be a parliament.'' ³ In the words of Mr. Leadam,
a parliarnent was then a “ sessional proceeding of the council,’' sometimes
held when all the estates were sitting, often after these had been dismissed.
The “ council in parliament,'’ as it was usually called, held such prestige
over the ‘¹ council out of parliament,'’ to use another contemporary phrase,
that the records seldom leave us in doubt as to which is meant. Now the
parliaments of Edward I were more widely inclusive of the estates and
other public bodies than they afterwards became. Besides the greater
estates of clergy and barons, there were the official councillors number-ing
more than a score, while even the courts of law were for the moment
brought together under a single institution. Pleas that would otherwise
pertain to the king's bench are recorded as being held coram reye in parlia-
mento. Even the exchequer carne under the same influence, for on one
occasion an action is reported as having been taken ad scaccarium in par-
