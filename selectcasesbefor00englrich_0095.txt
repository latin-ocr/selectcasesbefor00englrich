INTRODUCTION xci
commons complained that the deamess of herring there had previously
attracted the attention of parliament; they recalled the inquiries already
held, and they petitioned the king “to make due amendment for the
profit of the whole realm.'' ¹³ Taken in connexion with the petition for
freedom of trade generally “non obstante nulle chartre faite a contraire
avant ces heures,'’¹⁴ carried in the same parliament it is easy to see that
the opposition to Yarmouth was dominant and that the formal expression
of the royal assent was a practical negative to the real object of the peti-
tion, greater freedom of trade. A new charter, dated at Gloucesten 14
November, 2 Richard II (1378), was issued, granting to the townsmen of
Yarmouth “to have and enjoy all their franchises as well as they had
them'’ before the revocation of 1376.1⁵ It may be taken to have been
the defiance of parliament by John of Gaunt.

The proclamation at Lowestoft of the new charter led to riots and the
opposition renewed its energies. When parliament met at Northampton in
November, 1380, the inhabitants of Norfolk and Suffolk invoked the prin-
ciple laid down in the Parliament of Goucester, “that grants by charter
or letters patent contrary to statutes of general utility should be of none
effect.'' ¹⁶ They roundly declared that the charter recently granted had
been in despite of that statute and such an one as the parliament of 1376
had repealed because “qu'il feust damageouse et grevouse as Communes
d'Engleterre.’¹ ¹⁷ The burgesses, they complained‚ would “ not allow the
said commons at any time of the year to buy or sell victuals or merchan-
dise ” in Kirkley Road.¹⁸ A third commission was issued in 28 April,
1381‚¹⁹ again under the earl of Suffolk's ascendency, but this time including
the name of Robert Tresilian, appointed in the following year chief justice
of the king’s bench. It was the year of the Peasants' Rising‚ which broke
out at the end of May. Yarmouth had, as has been seen, secured the
favour of John of Gaunt, who was particularly hateful to the rebels.2⁰ A
band of them marched upon the town and compelled the burgesses to sur-
render their obnoxious eharter. This they cut into two pieces, one of which
they exhibited in various places in Suffolk to demonstrate their sympathy

that this principle was laid down in the
Parliament of Northampton and con-

¹⁵ A translation of this charter is given
by Palmer (p. 23), who ascribes it to 1379.
But inasmuch as parliament only sat at
Gloucester from 20 October to 16 Novem-
ber, 1378, and the king, judging from the
“ Foedera,” was only there between 8
October and 18 November, while in 1379
parliament was held in London, this must
be a mistake, perhaps arising out of the
fact that the date 2 Richard 11 covers
from 22 June, 1378-21 June, 1379.

The recital makes the mistake of saying

firmed in that of Gloucester. But the
Parliament of Northampton was held in
November, 1380, two years after that of
Gloucester. See Rot. Parl. iii, 75.
