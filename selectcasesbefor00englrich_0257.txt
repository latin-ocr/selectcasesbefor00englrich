Lownscror'r υ. YARMOUTH 67

Answer to the seventh article which begins: “ Also because that the
mariners are constrained so that they are not able to 5511 their herrings in
that part, etc.’'

The mariners are at their own will as is premised above and at all times
have used to go with their herrings into their own parts where the wind
serves them. Without that the said mariners are constrained as is above
said, as the people of Yarmouth will be able to prove in this present parlia-
ment.

Answer to the eighth article which begins: “ Also when the herrings
pass into private hands, etc.'’

Herring is not sold by constraint, for the fair of Yarmouth is free as
abovesaid, and if any private person should have misdone to the prejudice
of the said fair he may be punished for his trespass as is abovesaid.

Answer to the ninth article which begins: “ Also whereas divers pedlars
and carters of the Counties of Suffolk, Cambridge, Oxford‚ Huntingdon,
Bedford‚ Buckingham‚ Northampton, Leicester, and Essex, etc.”

All the counties of England except the County of Suffolk can have
good easy passage with horses [and] carts to the town of Yarmouth

without ferry of thern and there buy he1Ting at the same . . . as in
the said road or elsewhere without being put to such excessive costs and
expenses.

[Answer] to the tenth article which begins: “ Also our lord the king has
granted to the said bailifl‘s and burgesses his customs-duty in the said Road
and has annexed to the said haven, ete.’'

The herrings sold in the said road in fishing time . . . the vessels out-
side of these . . . herrings is sold are forfeitable to our lord the king,³⁸ for
which forfeitures the bailiffs of Yarmouth must answer as plainly appeareth
by the said charter ³⁹ and for this reason they have a barge . . . twenty
or thirty persons and sometimes more and sometimes less, all well known
men and of good [fame] and not to make war [but] to seize the said for-
feitures to the use of our lord the king without anything [doing] against
the peace. And to grant a fair in Kirkley Road for twenty pounds yearly
would be a great loss and damage to our lord the king and the whole
realm, for this would be to the ruin of the said town of Yarmouth, which
town has done many honourable and profitable [services] to the noble pro-
genitors of our [lord the king] and to the said realm as is well known by
many lords of England. And of this town . . . the king takes yearly for

ing, contrary to the said prohibition, to be shall inquire froin time to time, and take
applied to the uses of us and our heirs.'¹ them into the hand of us, and cause them

Ibid. 381. to be safely kept for our use, and answer
³⁹ The charter continues: “Of which to us and our heirs thereupon into the
forfeitures aforesaid we will, and have Exchequer . . . every year at the terms

granted for us and our heirs, that the of St. Michael and Easter.'¹ Ibid⁴
bailifl's . . . for the time being may and ⁴⁰ Probably for ‘¹ print,'' “ takes.'’
