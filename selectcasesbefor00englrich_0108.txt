ClV CASES BEFORE THE KING’S COUNCIL

manor, and declaring themselves to be not bondmen but tenants of the
crown domains.⁵ Tcnants of ancient demesne they could not claim to be.
This claim the king caused to be investigated by the inquisition here set
forth (p. 83), which supported the contention of the tenants of Wink-
field but not those of the neighboring manor of Hurst. As to the merits of
1110 0350, we know that in Domesday Book, Winkfield is entered as a tene-
ment of the abbey.⁶ But according to a deed of 1348, there had been a
later transfer, by which Old Windsor, New Windsor, Winkfield, and Ascot
became parcel of the castle and manor of Windsor.⁷ Though the abbot
enjoyed the principal part of the revenues of the manor, he held these not
as lord but by special gift of the king. Henceforth Winkfield is 111011-
tioned as the king⁷s manor, but Hurst was confirmed as a tenement of the
abbot.8

The tenants of Winkfield were encouraged to make a further statement
of their grievances (p. 84), but whether they ever obtained redress for
their ills is doubtful. Apparently the king was inore concerned in prevent-
ing any reduction of their services. In 1397, and again in 1398, he sent
forth a commission to inquire into the concealment and withdrawal of
dues pertaining to his 11131101 of Winkfield and also the oppression of his
tenants there.⁹ Here the matter is dropped. Another result, due not
entirely to the uprisings in Berkshire, was the Statute 17 Rich. II, c. 8,
passed in 1394, reciting that unlawful assemblies and riots against the
king's peace have occurred, forbidding such assemblies in the future, and
requiring sheriffs to suppress them with the full power of the counties.

ATTE WODE v. CLIFFORD

The case of Alte Wode v. Clifford is another case of maintenance and
embracery, illustrating various phases of the extensive general problem.
The principal defendant, J ames Clifford, Esquire, of Gloucestershire, was a
turbulent character, who was accustomed to league with other men of the
county, with a view to preying upon their weaker neighbours. Their method
was to seize an estate at an opportune moment, and then by force and fraud
to thwart any legal processes begun against them. Sometimes, as in the
present case, by holding a man in durance, they would extort from him
enfeoffments to their advantage. Yet while charges of this kind were laid
against him, Clifford was an honoured man in the county, serving on the
king's commissions and keeping the castle of Caldecote. Among the com-
plaints which he was from time to time called to answer, was one in 1399¹
