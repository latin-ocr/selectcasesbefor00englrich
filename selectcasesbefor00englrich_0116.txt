cxii CASES BEFORE THE K1NG’s cormcn,

Wales. He had scrved in the wars and in the council of Henry IV and
Henry V, but he was now an aged man and his politica] influence was visibly
waning. The other was Sir John Cornwall‚ a new man, who had risen
rapidly from obscure origin to be next to Lord Grey the leading landlord
of the county. He had lately been created a baron under the title Lord
F anhope and was a member of the king's council. Whether the root of
the trouble lay in personal jealousy or the quarrels of their respective re-
tainers and allies, we are not informed. At all events there came a clash
in the spring of 1437 over the appointment of four justices, apart from the
regular justices of the peace, to inquire into selonies, insurrections‚ tres-
passes, etc, occurring within the county.² Although two of the justices
were friends of Lord Fanhope‚ it is not clear that his lordship had anything
to do with their appointment. Lord Grey, however, suspected that they
were acting in the interests of his rival. When the commissioners then
came to Silsoe and endeavored to hold session in front of the chureh, Lord
Grey came up with 50 or 60 armed men, and begged to know why they had
chosen his church as the place of their session.³ They must have chosen
it, he said, “ in despite of him,” yet he would not obstruet the session but
wait to see what they meant to do. His ally John Enderby, who had come
with 100 or 120 men, said that the commission had been stolen and was
intended to indict the tenants of Lord Grey. On the other hand Lord
Fanhope, who was on hand with 60 men, affected suspicion of the com-
mission because it was holding session in the town of his rival. While the
armed forces of both sides were inci-easing, through the mediation of Sir
Thomas Wauton it was agreed that Lord Fanhope with his men should
move to one side of the town and Lord Grey to the other. John Enderby
as justice of the peace in the county promised to hold sessions of the peace,
and the commissioners because of the danger in proceeding further decided
to adjourn their sessions. These facts were elicited in an examination
before the council at Westminster, where for several days the commissioners
were questioned on the affair.4 But as happened too frequently in events
of this kind, no action so far as we know was taken either by the council or
by the justices of the peace.

On 12 January, 1439, there was a similar occurrence at the town of Bed-
ford, which came still nearer to a warlike outbreak. During the interval
of the past year and a half it appears that Lord Fanhope had gained an
advantage by excluding his rivals, particularly John Enderby and Thomas
Wauton, from appointment as justices of the peace.⁵ They retaliated by
securing a special commission ⁶ issued to Sir Thomas Wauton, John En-
