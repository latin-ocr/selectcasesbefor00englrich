CITIZENS OF LONDON v. THE BISHOP OF ΒΑΤΗ 11

warden of the Fleet, issued according to the statute of accounts‚²⁰ for his
deliverance‚ and often he tendered sufficient mainprise.²¹ But the warden
dared do nothing for the commandments of the king, but answered that the
bishop had commanded him to make no deliverance of his body, unless he
found surety of 3320, contrary to the contents of the writs and the form of
the statute. And now at this parliament ²2 he has purchased a new writ
and found good mainprise‚ but the bishop was unwilling to allow his
deliverance so long as he remained treasurer. Wherefore Pier now prays to
the king, for God’s sake, that in respect of this great duress and wrongful
imprisonment and confinement contrary to these writs justice may be done
to him.

To our lord the king and his council beseecheth Hugh of Kent, amiourer,
that they wil] have him paid 12 shillings which the bishop of Bath owes
him for a pair of greaves‚2³ one pair of thigh pieces,²⁴ one pair of poulaines²5
and plates for the feet, which were taken from his house by the bishop's
command for the use of his cousin without the payment of a penny, nor
after this had been done could he ever obtain payment, whereof he prays
you, for God's sake, (to grant) grace and remedy for this debt.

To our lord the king and his council Henry le ΒΟΙΘ,28 citizen of London,
complains that when he was sheriff of London a horse worth 8 marks was
taken as deodand and given over to the said Henly as sheriff of London to
answer to the king sor the said 8 marks. This horse Master William de la
March then treasurer of our lord the king seized and had the said horse
taken from the care of the said Henry without making him any allowance
for it, so that he is still charged wrongfully for the said 8 marks, wherefore
he prays for remedy that the said 8 marks may be allowed him together
with the food of the said horse to the amount of 10 shillings.

Edward, in order to make him render account for the manor of Whitting-
ton, where he was neither minister nor receiver but only surveyor by his
