MOLYNs v. FIENNES 51

John the son of the aforesaid John and Gill died without an heir procreated
of his body and so Gill herself holds the aforesaid manor for the term of her
life, after whose death the aforesaid manor ought to pass in remainder to
William brother of the aforesaid John son of the same John de Molyns and
Gill, which William is indeed son and heir of the aforesaid John de Molyns,
and so as well the fec simple as the fee tail is in the person of the aforesaid
William apart from whom Gill herself can not answer of right and prays aid

, of the aforesaid William ²⁴ and that a premunire be issued. And Robert de

Fiennes of F rance by Michael Skyllyng his attorney says that the king
according to the treaty of peace aforesaid without other process is able and
is bound to restore the said manor to Robert de Fiennes. But that it might
be known if the aforementioned Gill had any right to bar the aforemen-
tioned Robert de F iennes from action touching the said manor, the same
king out of his eourtesy granted the writ aforesaid against the aforemen-
tioned Gill for having a final answer upon the declaration of his right afore-
said and issued that writ for no other purpose and so in execution of this
writ founded upon the peace aforesaid which the king by the bond of an
oath is bound to observe and within one year from the time of the restora-
tion of the same peace to fulfil, there is no need for such process of praying
aid or other dilatory pleas as in other writs at the common law.²⁵ And like-
wise a certain other writ of scire facias was sued out against the aforemen-
tioned William de Molyns touching the manor aforesaid, who in his plea
alleged that he was not himself tenant of the manor aforesaid and that he
had nothing in the maner aforesaid save in remainder after the death of the
said Gill according to the form of the fine aforesaid and that he is not
bound to make answer to that writ. And the same William was asked
whether to save his right in this behalf he was willing to plead jointly with
the aforementioned Gill, which he utterly refused to do. And so the same
Robert de Fiennes says that the aid prayed is in this case not to be granted,
wherefore from the causes premised and from others the same Gill was told
to answer without aid of the same William de Molyns if she should think
fit. And the aforesaid Gill protesting ²⁶ that she does not know that the
aforesaid Robert de Fiennes of F rance is a cousin or of the blood of Robert
the son of William de Fiennes, nor that the aforesaid manor was seized into
the hand of the lord the king by occasion of the war, says that the aforesaid
Robert de Fiennes who now sues was born in the time of Edward father of
the king that now is out of the liegeance of England and not within it and
this he offers to prove and asks judgment whether the same Robert de
Fiennes of France ought to have execution ²⁷ as any one’s heir, especially
since this would manifestly be contrary to the law of England hitherto used

²⁵ A reason why this was a case for the to db, that issue can not be joined by it.''
