entirely with bishoprics,⁵ whereas the principal part of the problem lies
with a multitude of minor places in the church. How many of these were
involved at any time, we have little statistical information. Can we rightly
estimate the number from the demand of Pope Gregory LX, as reported by
Matthew of Paris, that he should have the disposal of as many as 300
benefices in England ¹? ⁶ Are we to take at its face value the complaint of
the barons made at the first council of Lyons, that Italians were holding
benefices in the country to the value of 60,ΟΟΟ marks a year?⁷ Or is the
promise of Innocent IV that he would confer no more than twelve benefices
in England‚s a better guide to the practical extent of the problem ἵ) But
it is not the extent of papal provisions so much as the nature of the rights
in dispute‚ bringing about a conflict of church and state, that is now sug-
gested for consideration.

Out of the mass of correspondence that passed between England and
Rome during the thirteenth century, it is not always easy to discover the
grounds upon which the papacy based its claims in the matter of provisions.
For in most cases the pope advanced no positive claim to a benefice but
preferably requested it for his own nominee, urging his need of support and
appealing to a sense of duty, sometimes threatening those who opposed
him. That is, the papa] rights were extended by moral and politica] pres-
sure more than by legal right. But out of the manifold contentions‚ there
emerge the following guiding principles.

1. The power of the pope, and therefore the peculiar problem of pro-
visions, pertained only to benefices in the gift of the clergy. Gregory IX
acknowledged this in a letter in 1239 to the English barons, whereby he
confirmed the rights of lay patrons to their benefices‚ at the same time re-
voking a provision that he had made affecting a lay patron.⁹ It is not clear
whether this limitation was a voluntary act on the part of the pope, and
therefore of canonical validity, or whether it was a concession of the
moment to meet the demands of the barons. At all events, the restriction
was recognized, is not by canon law, certainly in the courts of common law
and in general was practically operative.¹⁰ Even within these limitS, as
the cases before us will show, the interests of lay patrons were seriously
affected, so that it was the barons more than the clergy who opposed the
papal demands.

2. The death of an incumbent in the curia at Rome, possibly of a pilgrim
on the way to Rome, left his benefice to be filled by the pope and the pope
