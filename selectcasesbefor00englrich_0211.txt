[Εηᾱονεεώ -] By virtue of this writ we have forewarned the within
written Henry Cove, William Cove, Geoffrey Bernham, Thomas Moulton,
William Woodford, Thomas Everard, Adam Wroksham, Henry Forester,
John Berne, Simon Worsted, Adam Everard, John Stapeley, Walter Ber-
neye, John Wiehingham, Thomas Starkolf‚ John Reading, Walter Bret,
John Ellesdone and Nicholas Plunket to be before you at the day and place
contained in the writ to do according to the within command under the
penalty contained in the writ by
John Penne ³⁵ and
John Brown.36

The within written Alan Everard has nothing in our bailiwick whereby
he can be forewarned.

³⁴ The researches of Foss were not suc-
cessful in tracing the career of william
Bul-stall further back than 1371, when
iointly with three others he was appointed
a commissioner of the Great Seal during
the absence of the chancellor, Sir Robert
Thorpe. (Isives os the Judqes [1851], iv,
38.) The publication of the Close Rolls,
however, discloses that in 1355 he was a
clerk of the chancery (22 February, Clo-«xe
leon, 184; 17 May, 1355, ib. 220). He
appears, unlaes it were another 01 the same
name, to have also held the livings of Mit-
talton and Deukoehull (Salop), in the
diocese of Hereford, which 116 resigned in
1358 (Pae. Rolls, p. 64). That it was the
same person is the more probable from the
fact that in 1375 116 116Ῑά the living of

Hoghton in the diocese of Durham, as
recorded by Foss. These facts indicate
that he was a non-resident pluralist. The
rest of his biography will be found in Foss,
who is, however, mistaken in saying 11181
his name does not occur after his superses-
sion as keeper of the rolls by John de
waltham 011 8 September, 1381 (Pal.
Rolls, p. 41), for ο11 1116 following 6 October
he, with six others, paid for a license to
alienate in mortmain the manor of Cad-
bury to the prior and convent of Bisshe-
made (Bushmead, Beda), ib. p. 51, 8
property which, however, appears to have
been parted with by the priory before
the Dissolution (Dugdale, Mo‘nast. vi,
