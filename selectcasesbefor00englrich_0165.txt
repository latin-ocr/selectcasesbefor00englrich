admitted and restored to the aforesaid treasurership, to hold according to
the tenor of the collation of the aforesaid supreme pontiff. He was told to
wait from day to day until etc. And it was agreed by the aforesaid king's
council that before anything further in the matter etc., the rolls and other
memoranda should be searched in reference to the king's right and the
estate of the aforesaid Walter in this part. And the said Walter, who was
present etc., was told that he on his part should make inquiries and have
search made of whatever may relate to the right of the king and his own
estate etc., showing and presenting the evidences which (relate) thereto
etc. The memoranda concerning the king’s right etc. having been searched,
it was discovered at the exchequer in the 29th roll of the present king in
the roll of accounts, to wit in the third roll of the account of John Lith-
greins ¹⁸ for the king's escheats beyond the Trent and for the revenues of
the archbishopric of York, during vacancy of the see, that the aforesaid
archbishopric was voided by the death of J. le Romeyn¹⁹ late archbishop
there, (that is) from the 12th day of March in the 24th year, when the said
archbishop died, and it was in the king’s hand from the said day by reason
of the said vacancy, and that the said escheator answered to the king for
its revenues from the same l2th day of March until the 22nd day of June in
the 25th year, until the king restored the temporalities of the aforesaid arch-
bishopric to Master Henry of Newerk²⁰ archbishop-elect etc. Hereupon
Walter of Bedewynde in behalf of the lord the king and himself declares
that whereas the aforesaid treasurership of York was vacant during the
vacancy of the aforesaid archbishopric while it was in the hand of the said
king, to whom the collation of the said treasurership as well as the collation
and presentation of other vacant benefices during the vacancy of the arch-
episcopal see rightfully belonged, by reason indeed of the temporalities of
the archbishopric etc. being in the king's hand, whereof the collation and
presentation belonged to the archbishop when the see was filled, (where-
fore) 'the lord the king himself has bestowed the said treasurership upon the
said Walter etc.,²¹ so that neither the lord the king in making this collation
nor the said Walter in receiving it etc. has done in jury to anyone. Having
been asked if he has anything to show concerning the vacancy of the afore-
said treasurership during the aforesaid vacancy of the archbishopric etc.,
the same Walter says that in the time of the aforesaid vacancy of the arch-
bishopric Lord Boniface, then supreme pontifi, judicially deprived John de
Sancto Vito, at the time treasurer of York, of the said treasurership as well
as of his other benefices etc., so that by this deprivation the said treasurer-
ship was vacant, while the temporalities of the archbishopric etc. were in
the king's hand. As to that deprivation he displays a certain public in-
strument testifying to it in the following words:

sherifl's were ordered not. to permit Walter appeals against him (ibid. 507). It will

to be molested in his possession and to benoticed that Bedewynde was nominated
arrest all persons making citations οι· ω the vacancy created between 12 March
