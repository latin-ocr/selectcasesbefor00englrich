TENANTS OF WINKFIELD v. ABBEY OF ABINGDON 84

and they make suit of court every third week, paying to the aforesaid
sheriff the hidage at the feast of St. Martin sum of 40 d. a year.
Also, the said tenants render to the aforesaid sheriff in the feast of St.
John the Baptist for each virgate ¹¹ of land one penny
sum of 27 d. a year.
Also, the said tenants render annually at the castle of Windsor for
pasture ¹² 12 d. at All Saints'.
Also, they render at the aforesaid Castle annually pannage ¹³ according
to the number of swine as it happens for swine.
The abbot and convent of Abingdon by gift of the king receive annu-
ally for each virgate of land for all services and customs 3 5.

These are the wrongs, grievances, and oppressions done to the poor
tenants of Winkfield reqardant to the lordship of the castle of Windsor in
particular. First, the abbot of Abingdon claims the said tenants as his
serfs, whereas they hold in chief of our lord the king, and this by excitation
and covin of John Benseld and William Staverton and others of their ad-
herents, which tenants they vex and harass from day to day, and have
imprisoned them at divers times, and this in order to make them admit
that they are serfs of the said abbot, whereas they are free and of free con-
dition, as plainly appears by the 1000051 just taken by virtue of a com-
mission given in this part to inquire of the tenure of the said tenants and
of the divers fees, customs, and services withdrawn from our said lord the
king in the said manor of Winkfield and elsewhere, which tenants have
been found free tenants of our lord 1110 king by the same inquest, and
then, because of 1110 purchase of the said commission for the profit of our
lord the king, the said John Benfeld, William Stamerton, and others of
their cov'm had the said tenants indicted, by virtue of which indictment
certain of the said tenants, namely Stephen Saward,¹4 Thomas Somerton,¹⁴¹
and John Saman ¹⁵ were seized and taken to London and were there de-
tained in the prison of the Fleet for half 3 year and more in great
duress, mischief, and disease, without other cause or process surmised
against them, and after their deliverance from the Fleet they were

payable by villeins only, freemen pre-
sumably having some wood-rights of their
own. There were different modes of com-
puting it, e. g. for 10 pigs the lord shall
