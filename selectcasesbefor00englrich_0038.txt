quished its claim upon them. Cases like F ouquire v. Nicole (p. 118) and
Nor-ton v. Colynqborne (p. 115) still appear, but in the course of events the
two courts were divergent in spirit. By reason of inherent character the
council was becoming the great criminal tribunal, while the chancery by
the entcrprise of its head and members was finding its greatest usefulness
as a court of equity.

Finally, the council assumed the power on occasion to deal with heretics,
uecromancers, soothsayms, witches‚ etc. There are not many cases of this
kind, but they are of interest as precedents for the greater activities of the
modern court against freedom of thought; also as showing a possible con-
nexion of the methods of the council with the heresy trials of the church.
An instance, cited by the Ecclesiastical Courts Commission (1883) as taking
place before the king's council, is the examination of William Buxton,
accused of being a schismatic, in 1384.1 The memorandum, however, gives
evidence of being not a record of the council but a distinctly ecclesiastical
document. Moreover the proceedings were conducted not before the
council, but before the king and a special assemblage, predominantly lay-
men, in time of parliament. Chancellor Pole was present and took part in
the disputation. The event only proves that the king’s councillors came in
contact with heresy trials. In 1388 Richard ΙΙ, then under the domination
of the Lords Appellant, appointed a commission to search for, take and
bring before the council all the heretical books being put forth by disciples
of Wiclif, and to arrest all persons buying and selling the same.2 Again in
1392 at the request of the bishop of Hereford‚ who confessed his inability to
arrest two men in his diocese said to be heretics, the king granted the
bishop authority with the aid of the sheriffs to arrest the men, wherever
they might be found, and bring them before the council.3 Whatever may
have been done by the council in these cases, we do not know. But in 1401
there is the clear instance of a soothsayer, John Kyme, who was brought
before the council where he was examined and finally made to swear that
he would never henceforth believe in false prophesies, or meddle with them,
or speak privately or openly against the state of the king.4 A few further
cases of the kind, which were brought up from time to time, give the im-
pression that the council was little disposed to attack heresy, unless it
might be connected with political interests or breaches of the peace. Once
it exhorted the bishop of Lincoln to act against persons accused of magio,
sorcery, and necromancy.⁵ Again, it made an examination of certain per-
sons thus accused.⁶ In 1441 one Roger Bolingbroke, a clerk implieated with
the duchess of Gloucester in the attempt by magic to shorten the king’s
life, was examined before the council and made to confess that he had
