Cli CASEs BEFORE THE KING'S COUNCIL

ceded all cases involving ‘⁴ such high personages that right could not be
done elsewhere.'' ⁴

When the matter was brought to the attention of the council on 10
January, a commission was issued to arrest Robert Yeo and his servant
John Langford.⁵ But for the same reasons as before the commission failed
of its purpose. The next move was the issue of a subpoena on 23 J anuary
to the carl and the sheriff as has already been told. This was effective.
The parties came and the trial began on the day set, 8 February. From
this point the record itself is the best narrative. The method of trial was
an examination into the charges made by William Esturmy, nominally in
behalf of the justices of the peace, that the earl had threatened the justices
and jurymen with violence. One by one the witnesses, nine in all, were
brought in, sworn and questioned in turn as to the words they had heard
from the earl. Any clivergences of testimony or prevarications under the
circumstances would have been readily detected. But they were all, in-
cluding even the earl's own messenger, in substantial agreement that he
had uttered the t-hreats attributed to him. After six days the earl himself
was examined in the presence of a score of lords in the council chamber.
He could make no defence3 although he claimed that his words to the
jurors were intended as reproaches rather than threats. He threw himself,
therefore, on the king's mercy. The council, consisting at the time of his
peers, with unusual severity condemned him to prison until he should pay
fine and ransom, at the same time in view of his royal blood and previous
good conduct, it commended him to the king's mercy. It may be with
excessive leniency, the king granted the earl a full pardon for every crime
heretofore perpetrated by him,6 and a few years later pardoned John
Langford who had committed the murder.⁷ It may be thought that the
earl's submission and humiliation was sufficient punishment for all that
he had (10116, but it is surprising to learn that during the week when the
trial was pending, on 12, 14, and 15 February, the earl of Devonshire is
recorded as present in the council, the same as other lords, deliberating on
the king’s l)usiness.⁸ With such tolerance toward wrongdoing shown by
the lords of the council, it is not strange that the statutes of livery and
maintenance for the next century failed of enforcement.

But the pardon of the earl of Devonshire was not the last word. On
the same day, 15 February, the king took dramatic advantage of the situa-
tion to exact from all the lords then present new pledges of loyalty. The
incident is described in a minute of the council in the following words:
