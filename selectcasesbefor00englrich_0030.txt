XXiV CASES BEFORE THE KING’S COUNCIL

brought into the ehancery where they were examined. It was then “ the
court,’y not the chaneellor, that ordered the defendants to make restitution.
Our Pet'itz'on os the H ansards (p. 76) in 1389 is the earliest instance yet found
of a petition in chancery followed by a decree. While the petition was
addresscd to the chancellor, the decree was pronounced by the council, and
then the chancellor made execution of the order.¹ This answers a question
once propounded by Mr. Pike. In view os the lack of records of decrees in
chancery, did not the chancellors at first treat such bills under the forms of
common law ’.Ρ 2 No; the evidence is that the earliest bills in chancery
were adjudicated by the council. Decrees by the chancellor came much
later.

Yet the Statute of Praemunire mentions the council or the chancery as
two alternative courts. What was the distinction ¹? From the inception of
the court of chancery there was one attribute that gave it a mark of dis-
tinction beside all other tribunaIS. This was the possibility, as we have
already intimated, of assembling the court at any time. As was suggested
by a suitor in the time of Richard ΙΙ, since the council in the usual course
was not to meet before Michaelmas, he asked that the chaneellor be com-
manded to summon it without delay. The council on the other hand, while
not restricted to terms, was inclined in all judicial business to observe the
terms and vacations set by the regular cour-ts. “ Out of term time,'' it was
enacted, “ nothing should be sped in the council but such thing as for the
good of the king and the land seemeth necessary . . . and may not abide
until the term time.'' The need of a court out of term time is expressed in
the Statute 13 Hen. IV, c. 7, which committed the enforcement of the law
against rioters “to the council, the king⁷s bench, or the chancery during]
zncMionf' In no way did the chancellors more certainly succeed in making
their court useful and popular, than by causing it to be open at all times to
suitors.

The student of the chancery is apt to state prematurely the separate
formation of the court. It was indeed distinct in all its administrative
features some time before its judicial capacity was recognized. Differ-ent
from the king’s bench, which separated from the council along the line of
the common law, the chancery during its formative period retained the
character of the original court, it made no departure of law, but simply con-
tinued the jurisdiction and procedure of the council. Its only merit was in
making these more widely available and practicable. Another error or
failure of perspective lies in treating the court of chancery as a direct
emanation of the royal prerogative. As a court of equity, it was neces-
sarily close to the king and dispensed his prerogative, but this was after the
manner of the council by consultation and advice. It was in a later stage
that the chancellor himself was deemed the keeper of the king‘s conscience.
