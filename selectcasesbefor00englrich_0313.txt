WYTHUM v. ΜΕΝ OF KAMPEN ¹

1418 To the very honourable and very sage council of the king our sovereign
lord.

Humbly beseecheth Hugh of Wythum ² of Boston that whereas a ship
of his named Gabriel while lying in parts of Prussia was there arrested
without reasonable cause at the suit of certain men of the town of Kam-
pen and was there detained under arrest for more than seven weeks, until
the attorneys and deputies of the said suppliant who were with the said
ship, in order to have deliverance of the said ship, made fine with the said
men of Kampen at their will, whereby the said suppliant has been put to
costs and damages of more than 5:30oe for if the said arrest had not oc-
curred his said ship would have come with The Gracc os God to Boston be-
fore the feast of St. Peter ad vincula,³ whereas a tempest arose by which
his said ship while coming toward the town of Boston was thrown upon a
rock on the coast of Norway and there shattered. And now Grote Court
and John Rode of the said town of Kampen with their two ships have come
to the said town of Boston. May it please your very sage discretions to
grant a writ to the bailiffs of Boston aforesaid to arrest the said two ships
of Kampen and to detain them under arrest until full restitution be made
to the said suppliant for the aforesaid costs and damages, according to

what good fajth and reason demand, for God and in way of charity.
