cviii CAsEs BEFORE THE KING’S COUNCIL

although the law was clear that if the vessel was on the sea, it should not be
adjudgcd deodand.2 Against claims of this character, it became customary
in the treaties of the fisteenth century to include articles acknowledging
the right of mariners, when driven by storm or rough water, to seek refuge
in ports and havens without making payments of any kind. But it was by
no means easy for the king to assert the higher law against tenacious local
customs. In the present petition it is intimated that the officers of the
countess had been unwilling to obey the king's letters. Since the matter
was referred to a commission of oyer and terminer the outcome of the case
is unknown. But in another case arising in 1422, as soon as it was learned
that a ship had been driven into a port of the countess and there stranded,
the king promptly sent thither his serjeant at anns to seize everything
contained in the ship and keep safely.³ Whether the ship was a wreck or
not, would then be judged in the king's court.

DANVERS v. BROKET

The case of Danvers v. Broket is an incident that occurred at the begin-
ning of the career of Robert Danvers, later a noted justice of common
pleas. His biography has been given a place in Foss, J udyes os Enqland‚¹
but it is incomplete at this point. Foss was unacquainted with the case but
noticed the following entry in the minutes of the council.

‘¹ On the lOth day (of July) in the llth year, at Westminster, there
was read and passed a certain act signed by the hands of the lords of the
council and remaining on file in the office of the privy seal among other
memoranda of the same, which begins as follows: Be it remembered² etc.'’

The act in question was the judgment of the council in the case now
presented.

The case was over the charge of Danvers that his opponents in a law
suit had rased and rewritten a part of a record affecting a claim in dispute.
Now the rasing of a record by any official had been made a penal offence.
and jurisdiction in such a matter had been definitely given to the council
by the Statute 8 Rich. 11.³ Moreover the forging of deeds had been carried
to such an extent that people everywhere, it is said, were disturbed over
their titles.⁴² Other statutes dealt with various aspects of the evil.⁵ In the
present case, it is proved, the parties instead of altering the record in ques-
tion, devised the singular scheme of erasing certain letters and then re-
