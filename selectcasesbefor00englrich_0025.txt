INTRODUCTION xix

Except as the statutes limited the council in certain respects, it is difficult
to see what was intended by this classification. Moreover in spite of its
suspicion of the council, parliament under the Lancastrians was wont to
leave at the close of its sessions whole masses of uneonsidered petitions,
under requirements that it should answer them within a limited time, that
it should aet with the advice of the justiees‚ or perhaps cause the bills to be
recorded upon the Rolls of Parliament.¹ The answer to a petition was
usually given in an endorsement solving the difficulty; it might name the
writ or direct the parties to the proper eourt; it might eonvey also a positive
opinion for the guidance of the justices. According to an often repeated
regulation, the council was to turn over to the courts all matters touehing
the common law. Lest private interests encroach on public business, the
council was enjoined to deal with the king’s business first. According to a
rule laid down in 1424 suitors were to present their petitions on a Wednes-
day, and find them answered and returned on the following F1·iday;² to
this a proviso was added in 1426 “ unless great and notable causes touching
the king's reahn and his lordships hinder.” ³ Under the difficulties of
getting answers to their petitions, suitors were importuning individual
councillors, so that for the sake of fairness it was enacted that lords of the
council should grant no favour in any suit but reply that the bill should be
seen by all and the party have answe1·.4 Other means resorted to by im-
portunate suitors was to addi-ess their petitions to the Lord Protector and
other individual lords of the council.5 Altogether there is evidence that the
council in addition to its other duties was overburdened with the load of
petitions. Following the example of parliament, on one occasion at the
close of a term it ordered that a pending plea, together with all remaining
petitions and acts, should be committed to the lord chancellor to be deter-
mined in the chancery.⁶ Thus out of the business that parliament and the
couneil had not the time or the energy to perform, the jurisdiction of the
ehancery was being built up.

Finally, as to the cases heard at length and terminated by the eouncil,
the evidence is that these formed the smallest part of the business taken up.
This was less from the lack of “ enormous causes,” as Coke supposed, than
from the inability of the council to give them attention. Even if a prelimi-
nary examination or a partial hearing was granted, the matter was most
likely to be given to one of the courts, a board of arbitration, or a special
commission for determination (e. g. Burton ·v. Meynell, p. 41). When
further hearing was possible, the cases were taken up in the midst of other
public business, quickly adjourned, and after repeated postponements
might fail of a final deeision. Of cases that were fully treated, it would be
