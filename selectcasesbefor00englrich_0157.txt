chants out⁴ of his own purse, unless 1118 king shows him favour, wherefore he
prays for grace, since he is so reduced that nothing is left to him.

To our lord the king and his council shows Richard 1118 brewer of 1118
town of Westminster, complaining against the bishop of Bath who, while
he was treasurer of our lord the king, took from the said Richard beer 1ο
1118 value of 5:18 165. fid„ for so long as the bishop was in this high office the
aforesaid Richard did 1101 dare to refuse him, nor did he dare 1ο demand his
chattel because of (1118 bishop’s) power of imprisonment, but this money was
kept from him for more than a year, whereby the said Richard is so im-
poverished that he has sold his house and all 11131 118 1135, 111 order to pay
merchants 3 part of 1118 debt he owes thern for corn (10 make) this beer.
But now he can 1101 borrow anything, bec-ause he owes the merchants so
much and is so much in arrear by this debt, but the aforesaid Richard, his
wife and children are nigh 1ο paying the penalty, unless our lord the king
and his council afford remedy in time, wherefore he prays remedy for
God's sake.

To 1118 honorable king of England and his council prays John Bone of
Wallingford 11131 whereas he was once bound 1ο Sir Adam of strattonffl in
518 of silver by a recognisance made 31 1118 exchequer of our lord 1118 king,
which ‚4318 the said John well and loyally paid according to the 1811115 of the
recognisance, so 11131 nothing is in arrears a long time before his forfeiture
and of these payments 1118 said John had good acquittances ensealed with
the seal of the same Sir Adam as is reasonable, but the treasurer of our lord
1118 king has had all 1118 recognisances searched which were made 10 1118
531118 Sir· Adam during the time 11131 118 was in 1118 service of our lord the
king. And he made 1118111 corne by his writs of 1118 exchequer to answer our
lord the king for the same debts. John Bone of wallingford, one of those
who prays for this grace, is arraigned by 1118 1183511181 111 full exchequer for
the aforesaid „818 by xdrtue of the recognisance; and 1118 answer is, and his
plea, in 11131 118 had made good his acquittances a long time before 1118 for-
feiture (of) Sir Adam, which (acquittances) should have availed him if he
could have had them in judgment, but he could 1101 possibly have 1118111 31
11115 time in allowance by reason of a severe mischance 11131 had sud-
denly happened 1ο him in 11131 118 was out of the country. That is 10 say,
1118 mischance was that the prior of wallingford⁶2 with his followers and
the wife of John Bone, by an exdl design wrought between 1118111 by
night, 51018 whatever moveables John had, 11131 15, such as were 11835-
ure of himself and others, and 3 strong-box with his jewels, in which
his acquittances were, bore them away, so 11131 1118 acquittances which

1115 propertiae continued to be held in hand release. The murder of Stratton is men-
and managed by the exchequer. As in 1118 tioned in 1304 (Cal. Cl. Rolls, 212).
