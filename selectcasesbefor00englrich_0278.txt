commissioners appointed 10 Jan. 1392 to
arrest Robert Yeo and John Langeford
in connection with the case now being
tried (Cal. Pat. Rolls, 82). On 6 061. 111
the same year 116 was made 3 retainer of
the king's household for life with a grant
of 40 marks a year (ibid. 186). He was
one of the arbitrators named in 1393 to
deal with a complaint against Philip
Courtenay (Rot. Part. iii, 302), and in
1394 was in another important judicial
commission touching a case of bribery
and intimidation of a iury (Cal. Pat. 420).
Η6 was a member of parliament for Wilts
in 1391 and in 1404, when he served as
speaker (A. I. Dasent, Speakers os the
Housc, p. 69); 3 member for Wilts in 1399,
1414, and 1422; also a iustice of the peace
in Wilts and sheriff in 1418. Under
Henry IV he was one of the commissioners
appointed in 1401 to treat with the duke
of Gueldres and in 1405 10 treat with the
grand master of the Teutonic Order and
with the Hanse (Foed. viii, 189, 395, 396).
He acquired many properties, having
nearly doubled his original inheritance be-

fore his death in 1426 (Cal. [ηιμ p. m.,
iv, 107). He left no son but his second
daughter Maud married Roger Seymour
great grandfather of Jane, queen of
Henry VIII.

⁴ The decision 10 summon the earl
was reached 31 3 meeting of the couneil
held on 23 Jan. 1392, according to an
entry in the clerk's Journal (The Kiny's
Councz'l, 490). The latter record differs
from the present one in stating that
letters, rather than a writ of summom,
were 10 be issued. Letters in fact were
more likely 10 136 issued in dealing with per-
sons of rank. Moreover the journal says
that a writ of subpoena was to be issued
to the sheriff of Devon requiring him to
come on 1116 same day.

⁵ 8 Feb. 1392.

⁶ Yoo, or Yo, a family whose name has
been supposed 10 601116 from their dwelling

western part of the county. This Robert,
son of John, of Heanton Saehville, held
Cotlegh in the hundred of Coliton (Prince,
