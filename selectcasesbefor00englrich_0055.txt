plaintiff being, on his mother’s side, the king's uncle and the bishop chan-
cellor of the exchequer. At first sight, too, the conflict of jurisdictions
threatened a serious collision between church and state. The bailiff of
Valence's manor of Inkberrow, Worcestershire‚ having with the assistance
of others arrested a robber, the bishop demanded the surrender of the
prisoner on the ground that he had been taken within the liberty of the
bishop’s Hundred of Oswaldslow. Upon refusal by the bailiff, the bishop
with that surprising levity which is peculiarly medieval, attempted to
enforce his temporal claims by the spiritual thunders of the church, and
excommunicated the captors. The excommunication was issued on 29th
July, following hard upon an inquisition held by the bishop at Hartlebury
on the previous day. The erown at once resented the vindication of
temporal jurisdiction by spiritual censures as an invasion of its prerogative.
In little more than a fortnight a royal prohibition was served upon the
bishop, while Valence’s bailiff appealed to the Court of Arches for relies
from the excommunication. The Court of Arches‚ before which the case
came in November, appears to have regarded the dispute as one affecting
temporal jurisdiction, which it waS, and annulled the excommunication.
Upon the point of jurisdiction the bishop thought it wise to tender his sub-
mission. The council, in the proceedings of which the king is stated to
have taken part, heard the case in the following J anuary. It emphasized as
the bishop's capital offence his invocation of the spiritual power. For this
affront to the crown the king’s attorney claimed a penalty of ten thousand
marks, besides compensation to William of Valence and his bailiff. Final
judgment on these minor points was reserved till the following Easter.

CITIZENS OF LONDON υ. BISHOP OF BATH

The petitions of the citizens of London complaining of the acts of
William de la Marche, the late treasurer of the exchequer, form a contribu-
tion to the history of the city at a critical period. The events here described
relate to the years between 1285 and 1298, when after a suspension of its
chartei-s the city was said to be in the king's hand. Just as had happened
on similar occasions before, most notably between 1265 and 1270, and again
in 1273, a warden (custos) was appointed by the king in place of the mayor,
and, it might be, king's bailiffs were set up instead of the local sheriffs.
Under these conditions the fiscal administration, and therefore to a con-
siderable extent the practical control of the city, devolved upon the king’s
treasurer¹ and the officials of the exchequer who are now attacked. In a
way the petitions remind us of the state trials held in 1290,² when the
