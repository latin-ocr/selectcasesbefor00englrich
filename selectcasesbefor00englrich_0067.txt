INTRODUCTION lxiii

Even the death of Bedewynde was not the end of the controversy over
the treasurership. Apparently the late treasurer gave up his office into
the hand of the king, for in 1326 Edward ΙΙ granted it to his clerk Robert
Baldok⁴⁴ by reason of the voidance of the archbishopric in the time of
Edward Ι.45 Edward III appointed William de la Mare in 1329,46 while
the pope appointed Cardinal Mortemart as a successor of Francis Gaetano.⁴⁷
The aspect of the question was then entirely changed by the king’s grant-
ing the cardinal permission to prosecute his claim, notwithstanding any
prohibition heretofore issued.⁴⁸ The king’s clerk lost his case in the papal
court and the church of York was placed under an interdict to enforce the
decree.⁴⁹ The king seemed to have abandoned his claim entirely, when in
1349 he undertook once more to grant the office which he claimed to have
recovered in the court of common pleas.⁵⁰ The pope however insisted on
a provision, but was willing to name the king's candidate, John Winwick.⁵¹
The king accepted the provisor on this basis. Thus a political advantage
was gained by a legal defeat. This brings us to a later aspect of the problem,
in which the king often secured the appointment of his own candidates by
means of papal provisions.

Under the temporizing policy of Edward ΙΙ and Edward III papal pro-
visions were permitted to increase, but it is not true to say that ‘⁶ up to the
year 1350 the right of provision was exercised without check.⁷' ⁵² As a
method of saving the royal rights, according to a form begun by Edward Ι,
the papal candidates were required to renounce anything in the pope’s
bulls or letters prejudicial to the crown. There was in fact a series of con-
flicts and test of claims in which it is true the king did not always win. To
cite a case of this sort, in 1327 King Edward III presented Geoffrey Cotes
to the church of Fishlake in the diocese of York,53 a collation of the priory
of Lewes then in hand. This appointment was met by a provision of the
same church to a curial, Peter Vaurelli, on the ground that the earl of
Surrey‚ patron of Lewes, had ceded his right to the pope.⁵⁴² This time the
king was persuaded to relinquish the defence of his candidate, by permitting
Peter to prosecute his claim in ecclesiastical courts.⁵⁵ In 1328 Geoffrey
made complaint in parliament that while he was in peaceful possession of
the church, there came Peter Vaurelli with bulls from Avignon and ousted
him.⁵⁶ He seems to have secured a judgment of the king’s court but he
