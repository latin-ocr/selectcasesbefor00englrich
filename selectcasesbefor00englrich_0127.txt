statutes of the king.⁷ And hereby it is wrongful‚ for whereas John of
Tauy ⁸ by the maintenance of the aforesaid Sir Solomon sued 8 11111 against

next after the feast of the Purification of our Lady the seventeenth year of
the reign of the king Edward.¹⁵ And they sold all the plough-oxen within
the eight days after the seizure and contrary to the st-atutes of our lord the
king.¹⁶ And by reason that they sold the plough-beasts while there were
other goods sufficient to the amount of the debt sued for and all the
other goods of Hugh were destroyed and sold at great loss by the com-
mand of Sir Solomon Rochester and by the hand of Thomas Bowdon
bailiff of the aforesaid Sir John Wotton then sheriff of Wiltshire that is to

defendant, or levied (lemrz' socias) out of
his goods and the fruits of his land.⁷'

beasts of plough.’'

things within doors, when other sufficient
distress might have been found, and that
without doors.” Britton (ed. F. M Nichols,
