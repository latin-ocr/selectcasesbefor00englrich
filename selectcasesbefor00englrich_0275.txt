PETITION OF THE HANSARD&

1389 To the very noble and very gracious lord, the chancellor ² of England,
Conrad Fynk,³ Gerard Clambeck and Warner Heynson, merchants of
Almain and of the Hansa, make humble supplication that whereas on the
28th day of January last the said suppliants with a ship called The Saint
M ary Km’yht, one-half of Kampen and the other half of Lubeek, laden with
40 13515 of barrels of herrings‚ that is 9 lasts belonging to the said Conrad‚
5 lasts to the said Gerard, 8 lasts to VVithman Claiston‚ 6 lasts to the said
Warner Heynson, 6 lasts to Hubert Bowman, and to Peter Scale of Dor-
trecht in Holland and Alard Henrison 4 burgess of Kampen, 3 lasts
each, the said Warner being merchant for Peter and Alard, were sailing
upon the sea towards Southampton there to sell the said herring, and they
sailed as far as the Isle of Wight. Here there came upon them two ships of
Plymouth, the one of Cok Wille and the other of Richard Rawe of Plymouth,
and these Englishmen wrongfully took their said ship and herring bringing
them to the port of Weymouth, to the great damage and loss of the said
suppliants‚ because the last was sold there for ‚435 which was well worth AEfi
at Southhampton, of which there were in the hands of John Gold of Wey-
mouth the money for 21 lasts; this money the said John Gold delivered
and it is in the hands of Sir John Ravenser‚⁵ clerk, by virtue of two writs
purchased of you, very noble lord, whereby the said merchants have re·
ceived 7 Iasts except 1 barrel, while the master has received for his freight
4 lasts. And so the said merchants of Almain and of the Hansa ought
to have 23 lasts 1 barreL and Peter Scale 3 lasts, and Alard Henrison of
Kampen 3 lasts; and also they have expended upon the suit from then
until now 23 marks, and since the men of Cok Wille and Richard Rawe
have the money for 8 lasts 1} barrels, wherefore in their presence the
council of our lord the king granted to the said suppliants that if they
could bring and show letters of their lord the duke of Gueldres and of other
towns they should be delivered and have fun restitution and deliverance
of their goods. Hereupon they have brought three letters of the duke of
complaint that as they were going to ⁵ A clerk in the king’s employ since
