lxvi CAsns BEFORE THE KING⁵s COUNcn,

REX v. GERDESTON

A case which was a cause celebre of the fourteenth century is for the first
time, so far as is known, printed at length here. It arose out of an en-
deavour on the part of one of the magnates of the realm, John de Warenne,
styled indifferently Earl Warenne, Earl of Surrey or Earl of Sussex, to obtain
a divorce from his wife Joan of Bar, granddaughter of Edward Ι and niece
of Edward ΙΙ, the reigning sovereign. From the Patent Roll of 1316 ¹ we
learn that Matilda Neirford, whom we know to have been the earl’s mis-
tress, brought a suit of nullity of marriage against the countess before
Thomas Gerdeston, archdeacon of Norfolk. The ground alleged was a pre-
contract wit-h herself which by the canon law was, under certain conditions,
held equivalent to a marriage.2 Upon such an alleged contract in the fol-
lowing century Edward V was declared illegitimate and deposed.³ The
case recorded here arose upon the initial step of the suit, the citation of the
countess. By the Constitutions of the Cardinal Legates Otho and Ottobon,
published in London in 1237, restrictions had been imposed upon the clergy
in dealing with matrimonial causes. Only men of prudence, trustworthi-
neSS, ancl legal knowledge were to handle questions of such importance.
Deans, archdeaconS, or abbotS, by privilege or custom exercising such
jurisdiction, might retain it with due care and diligence, but in any ease
definitive sentence was not to be pronounced without prior consultation
with the bishopfl Notwithstanding these restrictions, the persons primarily
here inculpated were the archdeacon's official and his deputy, one Robert,
chaplain of Yaxley, Norfolk, from which county the knightly family of
Neirford sprang. Both by royal charters and papal bulls, the palace was
exempt from ordinary ecclesiastical jurisdiction, yet the chaplain had ven-
tured to cite the countess in person when she was in attendance upon the
queen in the crypt of St. Stephen's. As he was but an underling, the official
and archdeacon himself were also proceeded against as responsible for him.
The offence of the archdeacon and his official was declared by the king’s
attorney punishable with a fine of ι,τΕἶ2Ο,ΟΟΟ, as being in contempt of the king
and “against his crown and dignity,” a form illustrating the antiquity of the
language of the modern indictment. By the citation the countess was
summoned to appear before the archdeacon or his commissary at Bracke-
