enacted that the majority (major pars) should decide. Before a final decrec
was reached, in all equitable cases, reference must be made to the king, for
the 0550000 of all such jurisdiction was a dispensation of the royal preroga-
tive. In contrast to the courts of common law, the council and likewise
the chancery were given little authority by general warram, and so re-
quired a special warrant in each separate case. Whether the decree should
then be pronounced by the council, or by the king on advice of the council,
usage is 00011101111ἕ.1 10 0111101 event, the final decree is the one part of the
record that must be written in court. In the briefcr cases this was done on
the dorse of the petitions, otherwise on a separate parchment. thther
because few cases came to a final decree, as the writer believes, having been
settled informally either in or out of court, or because there has been a (115-
proportional loss of such reem-ds, few of these decrees are extant. The case
of Whele v. Fortescue (p. 117) affords a good illustration of a decree in the
star chamber.

Finally, as to punishments and penalties‚ fines were imposed⁷ and im-
prisonment and chastisement inflicted without definite restriction. But
in view of the extra-legal character of its procedure, the council acted in
these matters with marked caution. Although the limitation as to life and
limb, desired by parliament, failed to be enacted in the statutes, the council
never failed to observe it. Even the 105501· forms of bodily 10011101100, 50011

were 1101 known in the middle ages. Only one of our cases (p. 104) men-
tions such a thing as the pillory. The penalties threatened in the subpoena
and other instruments were theoretical‚ to be understood as an intimation
of the seriousness of the matter in hand, and never literally exacted. Fines
were usually in the form of amerciaments, being adjusted not in proportion
to the offenee but whatever could feasibly be exacted in return for a pardon
or release. Imprisonments were indeterminate, “ until it is otherwise
ordered.” The Fleet was the prison particularly used by the council and
the chancery. Severe sentences were passed upon highwaymen‚ fraudulent
merchantS, and pirates; sometimes also upon 00001001 ministers, 05 10
Rex v. Μ iddleton (p. 37). Quite as often without any sentence, but as a
result of a trial, an officer was dismissed in disgrace, e. g. Rex v. M usqrave
(p. 54), Danvers v. Broket (p. 101). Even when criminality was involved
the council seemed to prefer the course of a civil suit, in which the parties
voluntarily submitted‚ 0. g. Atte Wode v. Clifford (p. 89). Here the defend-
ant was required to make restitution but escaped immediate condemnation.
In the treatment of knights and nobles, who were constantly proved to be
malfeasors, there was shown a surprising degree of leniency and timidity.
The severe sentence passed in Esturmy v. Courtenay (p. 81) is exceptional,
and then the defendant was recommended to mercy. Punitive sentences
