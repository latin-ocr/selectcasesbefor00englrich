XClV CASES BEFORE THE KING’S COUNCIL

l'asscnt du tout le Parlement.'' It will have been observed that the charter
thus objected to as an infr-ingement of the rights of parliament is dated at
the end of November. It appears probable, therefore, that the attribution
of 1387 to the petition is an accident, which may have arisen from the
postponement of the arrangement of the records of the parliament, which
was dissolved on 28 November, 1386, the date of the charter, until the
year had turned. This charter, dated 28 November, 10 Richard II (1386),
was maintained during the rest of Richard’s reign and during the reigns of
subsequent sovereigns.³‘¹ To what dates in the chequered story of this
protracted struggle are these four documents to be assigned respectively ἶ)
The earliest would seem to be the arguments (“ instances ”) advanced by
Lowestoft against the grant of the charter, for which it states the bailiffs
and burgesses of Yarmouth to be “now ⁷' suing. As it refers to Edward
III, as the reigning king's grandfather, it undoubtedly belongs to the time
of Richard II. But beyond this it affords no clue. The petition of Lowe-
stoft (document B) for the revocation of the charter after it had been
granted to Yarmouth by Richard ΙΙ, is based upon its first petition, with
amplifications and additions. It sets out in order the statutory history of
the controversy under Edward III. It adds to the counties enumerated
in the earlier petition, as aggrieved by the dearth of fish imputed to the
privileges of Yarmouth, those of Suffolk and Essex. But is gives no indi-
cation of the length of time during which the charter assailed had been in
force, nor of its own date. We can only infer this from C, the answer of
Yarmouth, which takes the yravamina of Lowestoft in Β, point by point.
By this answer the retrospective limit of date of the charter of which com-
plaint is made is fixed as 1378, the session of parliament held in October of
that year at Gloucester. The indorsement, though not wholly decipherable,
indicates that the case was heard in Hilary Term when parliament was
sitting at Westminster. This limitation would be satisfied in 1380, when
parliament met at Westminster on 16 January, the Monday after St.
Hilary. At that date the charter assailed would have been in force since
John of Gaunt's provisional order and the subsequent regrant of the charter,
about eighteen months. In January, 1382, also, the parliament, which had
met on 16 September, 1381, was still sitting at Westminster, and the charter,
though threatened, was remaining in force. But since the indorsement
uses the word “ tenuz,⁷’ eustomarily significative of the first meeting of
parliament, the document C should probably be assigned to J anuary, 1380,
as the date of its presentation to the crown. The condition of a session at
Westminster opening in Hilary Term does not seem to have been again
fulfilled until 1390, at which date the charter of 1386 had become a securely
established privilege. B then will probably have been draughted about
the close of 1379. Document D supplies no further light on this point,
and is simply a replication to C, to be dated 1380.
