INTRODUCTION CXV

The case, though it was never completed, is not without interest in
several particulars. It offers an iflustration, not frequent in the records of
the council‚ of the method of written pleadings in the form of bill, answer,
replication, and rejoinder. It also contains in these pleadings the most in-
timate description of the wool trade in these parts that we have prior to
the Cely Papers.² How the wool was purchased extensively on credit,
how it was bought up in the counties of England, then brought to London
and cocketed, how it was received and distributed at Calais are vividly
set forth in the complaint of the merchant. But on the merits of the suit
we can say little more, for proofs are entirely lacking. To the charges
made by Heyron the defendants at first demurred, then denied them en-
tirely. After these lengthy pleadings Heyron, evidently feeling that the
court was against him, suddenly discontinued the suit. With extraordinary
ingenuity he afterwards found a way of impleading certain of his opponent-s
in the court of the duke of Burgundy.³ At an opportune moment he caused
them to be arrested in the town of Bruges and tried for the injuries done to
him at Calais. The process is said to have been long continued in that
court, and was afterwards appealed to the king of France, as overlord of
Flanders, in the Parliament of Paris. Here it was dismissed, as we after-
wards learn, at the solicitation of the king of England. Fearing that
Heyron would implead them still further in foreign courts, the staplers suc-
ceeded in bringing the matter in 1478 before the king and parliament, by
whom it was ordained that proclamations should be made ordering Heyron
to desist in these proceedings. In spite of these inhibitions, Heyron found
one other resort in the court of Rome, where on charges of ill contract he
obtained in 1480, first a penal admonition and then an annullatory bull
against the Society of the Staplers. These sentences the staplers afterwards
induced the pope to revoke.

The last stage of the affair was an argument upon the question of Hey-
ron’s right as an English subject to sue in foreign courts and of the juris-
diction of the king's court in the matter. In 1480, Heyron returned to
England under letters of protection with the avowed purpose of suing in
the king’s court again. For the better safety of his person he sought sanc-
tuary in westminster Abbey. Here he was called upon to defend his con-
duct in having impleaded the king’s subjects in foreign courts. Our
knowledge of these events is based entirely on a record of the council, in
which it answers at length the pleadings of Heyron.4 The points in Hey-
ron's plea were (1) that under the treaties of intercourse with Burgundy,
he was permitted to sue in the duca] court, (2) that he had resorted to
