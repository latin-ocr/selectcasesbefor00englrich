lXXXVl CASES BEFORE THE KING’S COUNCIL

further, 011 pain of AEl‚000 to deliver under 5831 311 indictments for felony,
etc. made before him, and these were to be brought before the king's
council and then given to the justices of gaol delivery.¹⁵ Several of the
shcriff's ministers, we learn, were afterwards indicted before justices of
oyer and terminer, and according to a precept were to be removed from
office.¹⁶ The sheriff himself was given a day to be before the king⁷s coun-
cil,¹⁷ but whatever may have been done on that occasion, we do not know.¹⁸
In the case of Musgrave the council gave the charges a complete hearing.

The defence appears to rest in part upon a statute of 1331,1⁹ though it
is not expressly cited. The sheriff charged the complainants with robbery,
affrays, and what is now called blackmail; alleging that he had ample
grounds for suspicion. The statute of 1331, after reciting the Statute of
Winchester of 1285,20 enacts that suspicions strangers passing at night
are to be arrested and delivered to the sheriff, who is to keep them in ward
until the coming of the justices, that 15, of the royal judges. But, as a
“ keeper of the peace‚” his powers were far more extensive than those of
the county magistrate of today. By a statute of 1360‚2¹ from which, ac-
cording to 113111113111,22 1118 “ keepers of the peace ’¹ first acquired the higher
title of “ justices,'’ he was, as such, authorized, as one of a standing com-
mission, “to pursue, arrest, take and chastise offenders, rioters, and all
other barrators.'' As sheriff, therefore, he was empowered to arrest the
defendants as nightly marauders‚ and as justice of the peace to “ 8113511158 ”
them. Lastly, he pleads a special commission directed to him by the king
“ that he should make ari-est and execution of those who committed such
robberies and affrays‚ or otherwise he would be held as a maintainer of the
said robbers and malefactors.'' To the extremest lengths against persons
so influentially connected he did not venture to go, but contented himself
with imprisoning them in the jail at York, releasing them only upon heavy
bail and exacting a fine from Thomas Ughtred's servant, whom he is ac-
cused of having tortured, contrary to law‚²³ with the object of fabricating
evidence against the master.

With the establishment of the magisterial courts of quarter sessions in
1388,2⁴ the sheriffs' tourn became insignificant, except as an engine of
extortion, which it remained for another hundred years. Among the sheriffs’
devices was that of not bringing their prisoners before the justices of assize,
