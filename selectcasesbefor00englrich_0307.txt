LEGAT AND ANOTHER v. WODEWARD 92

the said chancellor brought> with him this record here into the council and
reported that the aforesaid justices had viewed and examined it, and that
it seemed to them this record was quite sufficient and legitimately made.

LEGAT AND ANOTHER v. WODEWARD¹
A

May it please you our lord the king to remember how on the twentieth
day of last May by your special grace you granted to your squires Helming
Legat ² and William Lowney ³ the custody of the manor of Bobbingworth 4
together with the advowson of the church of Bobbingworth during the non-
age of Thomas son and heir of Thomas Enfield ⁵ and so from heir to heir
until one of the said heirs arrives at full age, without rendering anything
to you for it ; this guardianship belongs to you because of the minor age
of the said Thomas son of Thomas Enfield, and your chancellor by bill of
your treasurer has committed it by your letters patent to William lYode-
ward “founder‚”⁶ and Agnes his wife⁷ during the nonage of the said heir.8
YVherefore, very gracious lord, may it please you to command your chan-
cellor to issue to the said Helming and William Lowney your letters patent.
for the custody of the aforesaid manor and advowson and to annul and
revoke the said letters patent issued by your said chancellor to the said
William Wodeward and Agnes. (This do) for God’s sake and in work of
charity.

. . ⁹ of and concerning the bill presented to the said parliament,¹⁰ fol—

lowing this schedule and . . . by the said council of the lord [the king] . . .

the manor of Fyfield which was put inthe
custody of William Woodward and his
wife mentioned below (ibid. 275).

⁶ A citizen of London and member of
the Founders' Company. In 1414 Henry
V commissioned him to take copper,
bronze, iron, and other metals for making
guns, to gather charcoal and saltpeter, to
bring together workmen and compel their
services for the king’s expedition. Cal.
Pat. 2 Hen. V, 292; Cal. Letter-books, K,

⁷ She was a kinswoman of the late
Thomas Enfield. Cal. Pac. 8 Hen. IV,
275.

⁸ This grant of Bobbingworth is miss-
ing, but it was probably similar to the
grant Just mentioned of the messuage in
Fyfield, dated 24 Nov. 1406. By an
agreement with the treasurer, Thomas
Neville, who issues a warrant to the chan-
cellor, William and his wife are put under

bonds to render a fixed sum yearly for the
estate during the minority of the heir,
maintaim'ng him and providing for his
marriage without disparity, and keeping
up the property without waste. Ibid.

⁹ The entire upper left-hand corner of
the membrane is torn away, but the
tenor of the record is easily followed
nevertheless.

¹⁰ There is no record of such a bill in
the Rolls os Parliammzt, but from what
follows we leam that a counter-suit was
begun by William and Agnes, who pre-
sented a petition in parliament complain-
ing that they had been removed. By
authority of parliament the matter was
given to the council, which caused the
following examination to be made in the
exchequer. On this procedure see Introd.‚
