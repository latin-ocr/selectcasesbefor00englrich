BISHOP OF SABINA v. BEDEWYNDE 25

Lord Edward, by the grace of God illustrious king of England‚ had and
was holding in his hand the archbishopric of York which was avoided
by the death of J. Archbishop of blessed memory, (we) do publicly pro-
test in this writing that by the admission of the said Theobald or his
proctor in his name to the canonry, prebend and treasurership, which
was required of us by reason of the sentences contained in the processes
of the said executors, we do not intend, nor do we even wish, so far as
lies in us, in any wise to derogate from the right which is anyhow suffi-
cient of the aforesaid lord king in regard to the collation, donation or
presentation of the said treasurership and prebend; nay more, (we say)
that all his right in this case remains safe, so long as it can or ought to
be saved by right and custom, notwithstanding this admission of ours.

Done in the year of Our Lord 1297, 18 November, in the eleventh

Indiction, in the presence of Hugh Menigthorp, rector of the church of

Bulmer in the diocese of York, William, rector of the church of Bottels-

ford in the diocese of Lincoln, Henry Baispole and John J akesley,

clerks, who were called and required as witnesseS. And I, Adam Low-
ther of the diocese of Carlisle, by authority public notary of the sacred
empire and at present notary of the venerable chapter of St. Peter's

York, was present during the statement of the aforesaid protestation

together with the aforesaid witnesses‚ and having written and published

it, I have signed it with my sign, by request.

And as to the point that is similarly contained in the aforesaid petition
that the lord the king knew that the said Theobald de Bar had possession of
the said treasurership and that (the king) favoured him etc. granting letters
of attorney in regard to it, and that he maintained the said Francis Gaetano
in possession of it etc. granting him similar letters of attorney etc., the said
Walter says that these letters do not derogate from the king's right to the
collation etc. since they do not assign any title of possession nor confirm
possession etc., nor (do they derogate from) the estate of the said Walter,
since he claims no estate in regard to it except by collation of the king at
the time when the collation rightfully belonged to the king, as has been
declared before, and (so) he asks that there be counsel in behalf of the king
and the said Walter in this part and that action be taken according to the
tenor of the said king’s mandate with regard to it as noted above.

The foregoing evidences having been viewed and the arguments of the
aforesaid Walter setting forth the king’s right, and his own estate etc. hav-
ing been heard, after holding diligent deliberation and discussion of the
matter, since it is evident that the lord the king by the right of his crown
etc. should bestow vacant benefices and also during the vacancy of the
archbishopric should present the beneficas the collation or praeentation of
which belongs to the archbishop when the see is filled etc., and because
there is no lapse of time for the lord the king etc. in regard to these things
which (pertain) to his royal right etc., nor has it been deduced or shown on
